# Solid 2.0 — not React, not Solid 1.x

This project uses Solid 2.0 (`solid-js` 2.x). The JSX looks like React but the
execution model is different: **a component function runs exactly once, at mount**. Updates
flow from signals/stores directly to the JSX expressions that read them. Components never
re-render. Solid 2.0 is also **incompatible with Solid 1.x** — treat all Solid 1.x knowledge
(pre-2.0 tutorials, blog posts, Stack Overflow answers) as wrong for this codebase.

Before writing non-trivial Solid code, read the `solid-2` skill
(`.cursor/skills/solid-2/SKILL.md` for Cursor, `.claude/skills/solid-2/SKILL.md` for
Claude Code) for full patterns, decision tables, and official documentation URLs.

## Hard rules (React reflexes to unlearn)

1. **Never destructure props.** `function C({ name })` and `const { name } = props` read the
   prop getter once at setup and kill reactivity. Keep `props.x` and read it inside JSX, a
   memo, or an effect compute function. Defaults go at the read site: `props.x ?? fallback`.
   Rest props: `omit(props, "label", "value")`, never `const rest = { ...props }` (a snapshot).
   JSX `{...rest}` is fine once `rest` is a reactive proxy. Rule of thumb: the string `props.`
   must never appear at component-body top level *as a read* (`const x = props.x`); nested
   functions (`() => props.x`, `omit(props, ...)`, `children(() => props.children)`) are fine.
   Mechanically enforced by `solid2-kit check` — run it after editing TSX.
2. **Never read reactive values at component-body top level.** The body runs once, untracked;
   `const v = count()` there is a frozen snapshot (Solid warns in dev). Carry the accessor
   (the function itself) into JSX and call it there.
3. Signals are read by **calling** them: `{count()}` in JSX, not `{count}`.
4. **Derived state is a function, not state + effect.** `const full = () => a() + b()`.
   Never write "a signal plus an effect that syncs it". That includes **reset**: to clear
   a signal when another reactive value changes, use a writable derivation —
   `createSignal(() => { source(); return initial; })` (re-runs when `source()` changes;
   the setter still works) — never a `createEffect` whose apply calls the setter. The
   derivation also moves the `source()` read to the read site, under its boundaries.
   Mechanically enforced by `solid2-kit check` (effects whose apply only writes a local
   signal). Use `createMemo` only for expensive
   computations, multiple consumers, or an equality boundary. When several writes can land
   before a flush, use the setter updater (`setCount((c) => c + 1)`); `setCount(count() + 1)`
   reads the last *committed* value and drops the other staged writes. To store a *function*
   in a signal, wrap it: `setHandler(() => myHandler)` — `setHandler(myHandler)` treats it
   as an updater.
5. `class`, not `className`; `for`, not `htmlFor`. `class` accepts strings, conditional
    objects, and nested arrays: `class={["btn", { active: selected() }]}`. Put *conditional*
    names in an object — `class={`btn ${on() ? "on" : ""}`}`, `clsx(...)`, and
    `.filter(Boolean).join(" ")` all work but rebuild the whole string, so Solid cannot
    add/remove one token. `style` objects use CSS property names
    (`"background-color"`, not `backgroundColor`) and numbers do NOT auto-append `px`
    (`width: `${n}px``).
6. **`onInput` for per-keystroke handling.** Solid's `onChange` is the native change event
    (fires on blur/commit), not React's per-keystroke `onChange`. Handlers receive native DOM
    events and run untracked — reading a signal inside a handler always gives the current
    value (stale closures cannot happen; `useCallback` equivalents are unnecessary).
    Checkboxes/radios use `checked={...}`, not `value`. Read fields with
    `event.currentTarget` (the element that owns the handler), not `event.target`
    (a nested child). Never pass a setter as the handler (`onClick={setCount}`) —
    that writes the event object; wrap it: `onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}`.
7. **Lists use `<For>`**, never `{list().map(...)}` in reactive JSX and never `key` props.
    `{todos().map((t) => <Row todo={t} />)}` *renders*, then recreates every row on each
    update. Row identity: default = item reference; `keyed={(item) => item.id}` = key function
    (child receives item as an accessor); `keyed={false}` = positional. **Rows from
    server/refetched data (fresh object references on every update — fetch results,
    subscription payloads) must use a key function on a stable id**, or every update
    recreates every row. Reference keying is for local arrays whose item identities are
    stable (e.g. store rows). Match the child signature to the mode: default item is the
    **raw** value (`todo.title`); `keyed={(t) => t.id}` / `keyed={false}` pass an
    **accessor** (`todo().title`). Mixing those still “runs” (you render a function, or
    throw). Empty lists: `fallback` on `<For>`, not a `.length` branch around it.
    Sliding windows: `<Repeat from={from()} count={n}>`, not `list.slice(from, from+n)`
    fed to `<For>` (that rebuilds the window array every time).
8. **Effects have two phases**: `createEffect(compute, apply)`. All reactive reads go in
    `compute`; its return value feeds `apply`, which does imperative work and may return a
    cleanup. Single-argument `createEffect(fn)` is an error in Solid 2. Do not substitute
    `createTrackedEffect` for that — it is an advanced one-callback form that cannot nest
    primitives. Most React `useEffect` code should not become an effect at all — see the skill.
9. **Stores update by mutating a draft**: `setStore(draft => { draft.user.name = "Ada" })`.
   Never rebuild with spreads — that destroys property-level subscriptions. Returning a new
   array from the setter (`setTodos((t) => t.filter(...))`) *renders* but is unkeyed — same
   identity loss as wholesale assignment; mutate the draft or `reconcile`. Stores are
   **property reads** (`todos.length`, `todo.title`), not accessors — never `todos()`.
10. **Async data is an async computation**: `createMemo(async () => ...)` (or
    `createMemo(() => fetchUser(id()))`) read under `<Loading>` / `<Errored>`.
    **Fetch high, block low** — creating/reading are like sync; consuming (await)
    and blocking (the boundary) are independent. Create the memo early, wrap only
    the read with `<Loading>`. Do not glue the boundary to the memo, and do not
    retarget intermediate props to `Promise<User>` / `Accessor<User>` — types stay
    `User`. Nested trees do not suspend: they fetch in parallel; a real waterfall
    looks like `fetchB(a().id)`. JSX component props are lazy (passing isn't reading):
    `<Child user={user()} />` then `{props.user.name}` under the child's
    `<Loading>` is the colorless form. `const u = user()` at the parent *is* a
    read and throws/snapshots there. Pass the memo itself only when the child
    must `refresh()` that source — `isPending(() => props.user)` works on the
    value. Read every reactive input **before the first
    `await`** — post-`await` reads do not subscribe, and in production the computation can
    sit pending with no retry. No `useEffect` + `setState` fetching, no `createResource`.
    `<Loading>` wraps the data slot, not page chrome. After first paint it keeps content
    during refetch (`isPending` for the indicator). Use `on={id()}` (the *value*, not the
    accessor) only when that identity change should show the fallback again. Do not start `fetch` (or any request) at component-body top
    level — that runs once at mount and is not a reactive source. Do not `try/catch` `NotReadyError` around a read, and do not
    use `loadingValue` / `seedLoadingValue` as the default first-flight UI — those skip
    `<Loading>`. `{latest(() => x())}` is a preview, not the visible answer.
    Default navigation holds: keep `selectedId()` so highlight and content stay
    consistent; `latest(selectedId)` only when the highlight should move first.
    Pair `class={{ pending: isPending(selectedId) }}` with a short CSS
    `transition-delay` so fast swaps do not flash.
    `isPending` is a per-expression question, not a global spinner: ask it of the
    async source, a derived prop (`isPending(() => props.story)`), or the write
    (`isPending(selectedId)`), even when the fetch lives in a child. It is
    the *refetch* indicator after a settled answer exists — do not use it as the
    first-load spinner (`<Loading>` owns that). Pass the accessor: `isPending(user)`,
    not `isPending(user())` (that evaluates the read before `isPending` runs).
    "Prop with local edits" = writable derivation:
    `createSignal(() => props.value)` or `createStore(() => props.value, fallback)`.
    `createOptimistic` is for an in-flight mutation, not a local editing session.
11. Context: the context object is the provider — `<MyContext value={{ theme, setTheme }}>`
    (no `.Provider`). Pass accessors/setters/stores through context, never snapshot values.
    `createContext<T>()` without a default throws when read outside a provider (good) — use
    that for any reactive payload. `createContext("light")` is only for a primitive static
    fallback; a dummy default on a store/signal context *runs* and then silently no-ops
    without a provider. Truly app-wide singletons (theme, session, locale) are a
    **module-level** signal/store — Context is subtree scoping, not a React-style
    app store. Module state is shared across SSR requests.
12. Refs: `let el!: HTMLDivElement` + `ref={el}` or `ref={(node) => (el = node)}`, or forward
    `props.ref`. Compose with arrays: `ref={[props.ref, (node) => (el = node)]}`. No
    `useRef`/`.current`. Ref callbacks run untracked and **without an owner**; their
    return values are ignored. Do not create effects or register cleanup inside a ref
    callback. For reusable directives, create owned primitives (`onSettled`) in a
    factory and return only the element callback. Component setup/teardown is
    `onSettled(() => { ...; return cleanup })` — `onCleanup` is for custom
    primitives and captured owners, not component bodies. Each `onSettled`
    registers a **single** fire (reads inside are untracked); ongoing
    imperative work is `createEffect`.
13. **Writes are staged** and commit on the next microtask. Event handlers need nothing
    special; tests and imperative integration code must call `flush()` before observing
    updated *synchronous* state or DOM. Waiting on an async memo is
    `await resolve(() => value())` (or Testing Library async queries), not `flush()`.
    Never call `flush()` inside an `action`.
14. Do not port these React tools — they have no Solid equivalent because the problems they
    solve don't exist: `useCallback`, `React.memo`, `forwardRef`, `useSyncExternalStore`,
    dependency arrays, `startTransition`/`useTransition` (updates are held and coordinated
    automatically; use `isPending` for indicators).
15. **Components return once.** Never early-return or conditionally return based on reactive
    values — the branch is chosen once at setup and frozen forever. Put conditionals inside
    JSX (`<Show>`, ternary, `<Switch>`/`<Match>`). Early returns on genuinely non-reactive
    values (build-time config, missing env) are fine. `<Switch>` is first-wins: later
    truthy `<Match>`es are skipped, not “all matching branches”.
16. Prefer `textContent` for text-only content. Use `innerHTML` only for trusted or
    sanitized markup — never interpolate user input into it, never React's
    `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and never combine `innerHTML` with JSX children (they fight
    over the same contents).
17. **Never narrow a reactive read with a non-null assertion** (`error()!.message`,
    `user()!`). Use `<Show when={value()}>` with a function child — it passes a
    **narrowed accessor**, so no `!` is needed:
    `<Show when={error()}>{(err) => <p>{err().message}</p>}</Show>`. For non-reactive
    zero-arg calls, use an explicit guard variable instead of `!`.
    Do not add `keyed` by default (the React `key` reflex) — default `Show`/`Match`
    keep children mounted; `keyed` remounts when identity changes.
    Mechanically enforced by `solid2-kit check`.
18. **Never hand-roll async UI state.** No `[loading, setLoading]` signals, no
    `data() === undefined` readiness branches, no `{ data, error }` signal pairs from
    integration layers. Model async as a computation (return a promise or async iterable
    from a memo/store) and let the framework own the states: first load = `<Loading>`
    fallback; refetch indicator = `isPending()`; errors = thrown into the graph and caught
    by `<Errored>`; speculative value = `latest()`. `<Errored>` is graph status, not a
    terminal React ErrorBoundary: it heals when the source succeeds again (refresh,
    live reconnect, input change). `reset` retries the collected *sources*, not a UI
    remount. Per-row mutation failures belong in an errors map the projection folds
    in (survives the optimistic overlay), not in `<Errored>` around the whole list.
    Making a client store "real" is additive: same setters, wrap mutations in
    `action`, swap `createOptimisticStore` and a file of server functions — do
    not rewrite `App.tsx` with loading/error branches.
    Mechanically enforced by `solid2-kit check` (loading-signal naming, zero-arg-call undefined checks).
19. **Refetch is `refresh(source)`** — rarely needed, but when it is, never fake it with a
    counter/version signal read inside the computation. Input-driven refetch is automatic
    (tracked inputs re-run the computation) and subscriptions push. Legit uses: after a
    mutation inside an `action`, and explicit reload buttons. Pair with `affects(source)`
    when the reload should present as pending — a bare `refresh()` re-asks quietly.
    These are three different APIs: core `refresh(source)` reruns a reactive source;
    router `revalidate(getUser.key)` invalidates the query cache; server-function
    `return reload({ revalidate: "todos" })` asks the integration to refresh cached
    data. Do not mix them.
20. **External collections flow into stores through reconciliation.** First choice:
    function-form `createStore(() => source, fallback)` / `createProjection` (reconcile
    automatically, keyed by `"id"`). Manual merge: `setStore(reconcile(fresh, "id"))` or
    apply `reconcile(fresh, "id")(draft.slot)` inside a draft setter. Plain wholesale
    assignment (`draft.todos = fresh`) renders correctly but notifies every subscriber
    under the path and destroys row identity — same class of problem as unkeyed `<For>`.
21. **Solid inputs do not rewind the DOM.** `value={v()}` writes only when `v` changes; a
    React-style controlled input that ignores invalid keystrokes silently breaks. To reject
    input, write back explicitly:
    `onInput={(e) => { if (valid(e.currentTarget.value)) setV(e.currentTarget.value); else e.currentTarget.value = v(); }}`.
22. Miscellaneous defaults: SSR-stable element ids come from `createUniqueId()` (never
    `Math.random()` or hardcoded duplicates); pass store data to `structuredClone` /
    `postMessage` / logs via `snapshot(store)` (proxies fail or leak reactivity); render
    modals/tooltips/overlays through `<Portal>` from `@solidjs/web`; mutations whose writes
    cross an async gap default to `action` + `createOptimistic`/`createOptimisticStore` —
    the sync mutation *is* the prediction (an overlay, discarded on settle); put
    `pending` on the record rather than a second copy of state. Do not snapshot
    and restore, disable optimistic rows until ack, mutex rapid clicks, or freeze
    unrelated writes because one action is in flight; failed-action replay is
    optional. Except reactive clients (e.g. Convex) whose subscriptions already push authoritative
    state after mutations. Compiler: `"jsxImportSource": "@solidjs/web"` (not `"solid-js"`);
    Vite plugin is `@solidjs/vite-plugin` (not `vite-plugin-solid`) — run `solid2-kit doctor`
    after touching `package.json` / tsconfig / root configs; it fails on React and Solid 1.x
    wiring. Server vs browser:
    `isServer` / `isDev` from `@solidjs/web`, or `clientOnly(() => import("./Widget"))` for
    browser-only components — never `typeof window` as the SSR boundary. Default
    `clientOnly` starts loading at declaration; `{ lazy: true }` defers until first
    render. `NoHydration` / `Hydration` split hydration *ownership*; they do not choose
    visible content — `clientOnly` is for components that must never run on the server.
    Pass a **function** to `render` / `hydrate` / `renderToString` / `renderToStream`
    (`render(() => <App />, root)`), never `render(<App />, root)`. `hydrate` when the
    container already holds SSR HTML; `render` for an empty mount. Client mode (the
    `@solidjs/vite-plugin` default) mounts with `render()` into an empty body — there is
    **no server HTML and no hydration mismatch**, so React's mismatch defenses
    ("server-safe" initial values adopted after mount, two-pass rendering) are unnecessary
    and can clobber persisted state; read `localStorage` / `matchMedia` directly when
    creating the signal. `renderToString`
    emits `<Loading>` fallbacks; async or lazy-route trees need
    `await renderToStream(() => <App />)` (one consumer: `pipe` / `pipeTo` / `readable`).
    When the app owns the document, emit `<HydrationScript />` once before app markup;
    extra roots get a distinct `renderId`. Import `GET` from
    `@solidjs/web/server-functions`, never `@solidjs/start`. `httpStatus` /
    `httpHeader` are scope *declarations* (call them bare in a component or
    fallback body), not event-time mutations. `JSON.stringify(store)`
    / `structuredClone(store)` without `snapshot(store)` can throw or leak proxies. Async SSR
    without `<Loading>` *works* but blocks the HTML shell until every read settles — wrap
    reads, or stream with `renderToStream`. `pipe` / `pipeTo` / `readable` each consume
    a stream render — use exactly one. `createRoot` is for tests, libraries, and
    non-render entry points; inside a component let `render` / the component owner
    own the scope. Async reads inside `<Portal>` start on the client — hoist the
    read above the portal. Navigation-shaped updates (a setter, then async computeds holding previous values)
    do not need core `action` — reach for it only when writes happen *after* async work.
    Invoke actions from handlers, not from memos or effects.
23. **Composition.** Pass `props.children` through when you only render them. Inspect or
    iterate children with `children(() => props.children)` (then `.toArray()`), never a
    setup-time snapshot. Code-split with `lazy(() => import("./X"))` under `<Loading>` —
    not `React.lazy` / `<Suspense>`. Named exports: `lazy(() => import("./pages"), { export: "About" })`
    — `lazy(() => import("./pages").then((m) => ({ default: m.About })))` hydrates wrong
    because the named export is not a call-site literal. Select a component from reactive
    state with `dynamic(() => ...)` from `@solidjs/web`
    (stable identity). If the project has `@solidjs/router`, routes are `createRouter({ routes })`
    at module scope — not JSX `<Route>` / `<A>` / `<HashRouter>`. That package's `action` /
    `query` are URL-addressable POST forms and a read cache — not core `action` /
    `refresh` from `solid-js`. Router mutations: `<form action={save} method="post">`
    (POST only; `.with(id)` binds args into the URL). `useAction` is JS-only. Cache
    reads: `query(fn, "name")` then `createMemo(() => getUser(id()))`; after a mutation
    `revalidate(getUser.key)`. Do not wrap mutations in `query` (an undeclared server
    function becomes GET). `Router.paths` is not the current location (`useLocation` /
    `useParams`); a route `preload` result is `props.data`. One router instance —
    Solid Router does not support nested `<Router>` / nested `createRouter`.
    In-app navigation is `useNavigate` or `<a href={Router.paths...}>`, not
    `window.location` / `history.pushState`. Trusted identity is
    `getRequestEvent()`, never a caller-supplied user id. Unscripted forms use
    the function `.url` (or a router `action`), not a hand-built `/_server/`
    path. Client history adapters do not select the SSR URL — pass
    `<Router url={request.url}>` (or rely on the request event). Secrets belong in
    `virtual:env/server`, never the `client` env map / `import.meta.env`. Document head is
    `<Title>` / `<Meta>` from `@solidjs/meta` with **no** `MetaProvider`. A static
    `<title>` in the document shell is the fallback; do not hardcode other tags
    (`<meta name="description">`) that Solid Meta should manage.
    Return `respond(value, { status, headers })` from a `"use server"` function, not
    `Response.json` — a raw `Response` is HTTP-handler control flow; scripted
    callers should receive the value. Cache GET reads with `Cache-Control` on that
    response, not a hand-rolled Solid cache. HTTP does not enforce TypeScript —
    validate inside the function; do not invent tRPC / RPC type-gen.
    Locals only the `"use server"` body reads (db, secrets) stay off the client.
    Do not add an API-route file just to wrap a database call — `"use server"`
    is the RPC. During SSR the call is in-process (no HTTP). After a mutation, `reload` /
    `revalidate` / single-flight — never a client `fetch` or an `onSettled` /
    `hydrate` refetch to "refresh the page". In-flight Promises serialize as
    Promises; `live()` embeds the first value in HTML and continues the stream on
    the client. Do not delay `renderToStream` for visual order (`<Reveal>` owns
    display). Do not write subscribe/unsubscribe in the component around `live()`.
    When the app has a server bundle (`ssr` or server functions), production is
    `handleRequest(request)` / Fetchable `fetch`; platform Vite plugins adopt that
    handler (Node: the template `server.js`). Client-only start mode is static
    `dist/client` — there is no handler to wrap. Request middleware is
    `start.middleware`, not Express `app.use`. Do not return
    components from `"use server"` unless the project already enabled the
    experimental `serverFunctions.components` flag. JSON-encodable server-function arguments
    only, unless `enableRichArguments()` was called once in the client entry
    (`Date` / `Map` / `Set` throw without it). `live()` connection state is
    `source.onstatus` (`"connected"` / `"reconnecting"` / `"closed"`), never a
    field in the yielded value. Sibling `<Loading>` reveal order is `<Reveal>`
    (`collapsed` suppresses tail skeletons under sequential order).

## Lint heritage: eslint-plugin-solid (Solid 1.x) intents carried into this file

`eslint-plugin-solid` targets Solid 1.x. **Do not install it** — its analyzer predates the
Solid 2 model and misreads two-phase `createEffect`, writable derivations
(`createSignal(fn)`), and draft setters as errors. Its still-valid intents are enforced here
instead, and `solid2-kit check` checks the mechanically detectable ones on the source
directory (default `src/`).

| `<MetaProvider>` | no provider — render `<Title>` / `<Meta>` / `<Link>` from `@solidjs/meta` anywhere |
| `use:directive`, `on:`/`oncapture:`, `attr:`/`bool:`, `/*@once*/` | `ref` callbacks, camelCase event props, standard attributes, keep values reactive |
| `resource.loading` / `resource.error` | `<Loading>` boundary / `<Errored>` boundary |

When unsure about any API, verify against the official Solid 2.0 docs — fetchable URLs are
listed in `references/official-docs.md` next to the `solid-2` skill. Do not guess from
Solid 1.x or React memory.

`createTrackedEffect`, `createRenderEffect`, and `storePath` exist in Solid 2 but
are not defaults: use two-phase `createEffect` unless a single tracked callback is
required, and draft setters instead of `storePath` except while converting 1.x
path setters.
