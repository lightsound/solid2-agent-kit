# Writing Solid 2.0

This project uses Solid 2.0 (`solid-js` 2.x) with `@solidjs/web`. The hard rules are
installed by solid2-agent-kit as an always-applied rules file (`.cursor/rules/solid-2.mdc`
for Cursor; a managed block in `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code). This skill adds the mental
model, decision tables, and canonical patterns. When an API is in doubt, verify against the
official docs — see [Checking the official docs](#checking-the-official-docs).

## The one difference everything follows from

React re-runs component functions to compute the next UI. **Solid runs a component function
once, at mount.** After that, signals and stores notify only the computations and JSX
expressions that read them. There is no re-render, no reconciliation of component output,
no snapshot props, no stale closures, no dependency arrays.

Practical consequences:

- Values must travel as **accessors (functions)**, not as extracted values. Extracting a
  value at component-body top level freezes it forever.
- The component body is **untracked**. Tracking scopes are: JSX expressions, `createMemo`
  compute, `createEffect` compute (first argument), and boundary children.
- Event handlers run untracked: they always read current values and never subscribe.
- Object identity is stable: handlers, context values, and props objects are created once.
  `useCallback` / `useMemo`-for-identity / `React.memo` have no purpose here.

## Decision tables

### Where does state live?

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Scalar local state (count, open/closed, text input) | `createSignal(value)` in the component |
| Object/array state where parts update independently (forms, lists, nested data) | `createStore(value)` — property-level subscriptions |
| Object that is replaced wholesale (fetch response, selected item, `User \| null`) | `createSignal(objectValue)` |
| Value derived from other reactive values | plain function `() => ...` (never a signal synced by an effect) |
| Expensive derivation, multiple consumers, or equality boundary needed | `createMemo(() => ...)` |
| Follows a prop but user can locally override; prop change resets | writable derivation: `createSignal(() => props.value)` / `createStore(() => props.value, fallback)` |
| Shared by a subtree, independent per provider instance | signal/store created inside a provider component, passed via context |
| Truly app-wide singleton (theme, session, locale) | module-level signal/store (beware SSR: module state is shared across requests) |
| Tentative value during a mutation | `createOptimistic` / `createOptimisticStore` + `action` |
| Values pushed by an external subscription (websocket, reactive client) | async iterable returned from a memo (or function-form `createStore` for keyed reconciliation) — never `{ data, error }` signal pairs |

### Should this be an effect?

Most React `useEffect` code should NOT become `createEffect`:

| React habit | Solid 2 |
|---|---|
| Compute a rendered value in an effect | plain function or `createMemo` |
| Fetch data in an effect, copy into state | `createMemo(async () => ...)` + `<Loading>` |
| React to a user interaction | do the work in the event handler or an `action` |
| Sync one state into another | delete the second state; derive it |
| Reset/clear state when another reactive value changes | writable derivation: `createSignal(() => { source(); return initial; })` — not an effect calling the setter |
| Push a settled reactive value into a non-Solid system (DOM API, third-party widget, analytics, subscription) | `createEffect(compute, apply)` — this is the only real use |
| One-time setup after mount (`onMount`) | `onSettled(() => { ...; return cleanup })` |
| Measure DOM / observe size after paint | ref **directive factory** + `onSettled` (writes a *new* input; not an effect that copies state) |

### Composition, code-splitting, SSR

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Wrapper that only renders its children | `{props.children}` — no helper |
| Inspect, count, or iterate children | `children(() => props.children)` then `.toArray()` |
| Code-split a component | `lazy(() => import("./X"))` read under `<Loading>` |
| Named export from a lazy module | `lazy(() => import("./pages"), { export: "About" })` |
| Pick a component/tag from reactive state | `dynamic(() => ...)` from `@solidjs/web` (stable identity; prefer over `<Dynamic>`) |
| Overlay / modal | `<Portal>` — hoist async reads *above* the portal (reads inside start on the client) |
| Async value used several layers down | Create the memo high; pass `value={memo()}` through intermediates (they do not wait); put `<Loading>` around the leaf read |
| Nested child with its own fetch | Leave it nested — it runs in parallel. Sequential only when the second call needs the first response (`fetchAuthor(story().authorId)`) |
| Browser-only widget (charts, maps, `window`) | `clientOnly(() => import("./Chart"))` from `@solidjs/web` (`{ lazy: true }` defers the import until first render) |
| Server vs browser branch | `isServer` / `isDev` from `@solidjs/web` (build-time constants), not `typeof window` |
| SSR-stable `id` / `for` / `aria-*` pairing | `createUniqueId()` |

## Canonical patterns

### Component with local state and derived value

```tsx
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  const doubled = () => count() * 2; // derivation: a function, not a memo, not an effect

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>
      {count()} x 2 = {doubled()}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Props: read late, never destructure

```tsx
// CORRECT — reads happen inside JSX (a tracking scope)
function Greeting(props: { name: string; punctuation?: string }) {
  return <p>Hello, {props.name}{props.punctuation ?? '.'}</p>;
}

// WRONG — reads the getter once at setup; never updates again
function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) { /* ... */ }
```

To give a derived prop a local name, name the *function* (or `createMemo` if expensive):

```tsx
const full = () => `${props.first} ${props.last}`;
```

To merge defaults or split props reactively use `merge` / `omit` from `solid-js`
(replacements for Solid 1.x `mergeProps` / `splitProps`). `merge` is like
`Object.assign`: an explicit `undefined` **overrides** the previous source.
Omitted keys still fall through, so `merge({ type: "button" }, props)` is the
usual defaults pattern. That is not Solid 1 `mergeProps`, which ignored
`undefined`. Forwarding leftover props: `const rest = omit(props, "label")` then
`<input {...rest} />`. `const rest = { ...props }` compiles and then never updates.

### Store updates (draft mutation)

```tsx
import { createStore } from 'solid-js';

const [profile, setProfile] = createStore({ name: 'Ada', role: 'Engineer' });

setProfile((draft) => {
  draft.name = 'Grace'; // only readers of .name re-run
});
```

**External collections enter stores through reconciliation, never wholesale assignment.**
`draft.todos = serverTodos` renders correctly but replaces every object identity — all
subscribers under the path re-run and row identity is lost. In order of preference:

1. Function-form `createStore(() => source, fallback)` or `createProjection` — reconcile
   automatically (keyed by `"id"`), surviving items keep proxy identity.
2. Manual merge: `setTodos(reconcile(fresh, 'id'))`, or on a nested slot
   `setState((draft) => { reconcile(fresh, 'id')(draft.todos); })`. Positional data
   (fixed-shape dashboards): `reconcile(next, null)`.

Plain non-reactive copy for logging/serialization/`structuredClone`: `snapshot(store)`.
Subscribe an effect compute to every nested change: `deep(store)`.

### Children: pass through, or resolve with `children()`

Most wrappers just render `props.children`. Use the `children` helper only when
the component must **inspect or iterate** them. It returns an accessor with
`.toArray()`. The helper call belongs in the component body; the read of
`props.children` is inside the accessor (a tracking scope), so this is not a
setup-time snapshot. Do not assign `const kids = props.children` and do not
treat resolved children as a reactive data list for `<For>` —
render `{resolved.toArray()}`, not `<For each={resolved()}>`:

```tsx
import { children, type ParentProps } from 'solid-js';

function Stack(props: ParentProps) {
  const resolved = children(() => props.children);
  return <div class="stack">{resolved.toArray()}</div>;
}
```

### Code-splitting: `lazy` + `<Loading>`

```tsx
import { lazy, Loading } from 'solid-js';

const Profile = lazy(() => import('./Profile'));
const About = lazy(() => import('./pages'), { export: 'About' });

<Loading fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <Profile id="42" />
</Loading>

<button type="button" onMouseEnter={() => Profile.preload()}>Open profile</button>
```

Never `React.lazy` / `<Suspense>`. The lazy component suspends through
`<Loading>` on first render; `.preload()` starts the import early. Named
exports must use `{ export: "About" }` — a `.then((m) => ({ default: m.About }))`
wrapper hydrates incorrectly (the name is not a call-site literal).

### Dynamic component: `dynamic()` (canonical)

```tsx
import { createSignal, type Component } from 'solid-js';
import { dynamic } from '@solidjs/web';

const Compact: Component<{ value: string }> = (props) => <span>{props.value}</span>;
const Detailed: Component<{ value: string }> = (props) => <strong>{props.value}</strong>;

const [detailed, setDetailed] = createSignal(false);
const Result = dynamic(() => (detailed() ? Detailed : Compact));

<Result value="Current result" />
```

`dynamic()` returns a **stable** component whose source can be a component, an
intrinsic tag name, a promise, or empty. Prefer it over swapping a component
variable in JSX (`const View = tab() ? A : B` freezes the choice at setup).
`<Dynamic>` is the JSX spelling of the same primitive; application code should
use `dynamic()` so the component identity stays stable.

### Two-phase effect (imperative boundary only)

```tsx
import { createEffect } from 'solid-js';

createEffect(
  () => props.roomId,          // compute: ALL reactive reads here; return value feeds apply
  (roomId) => {                // apply: untracked imperative work
    const connection = chat.connect(roomId);
    return () => connection.close(); // cleanup before next run / on disposal
  },
);
```

Reads inside `apply` do not track. Extract every needed reactive value in `compute`
(e.g. `() => ({ name: user.name, role: user.role })`). Passing a store proxy into `apply`
and reading `user.name` there *runs once* and never retriggers. Compute-phase errors can be
intercepted with the bundle form `createEffect(compute, { effect, error })`.

A two-phase effect whose apply only calls a local signal setter is "state + effect" in
disguise — formally legal Solid 2, still rule 4 (`solid2-kit check` flags it). The reset
form of a writable derivation replaces it, and moves the source read to the read site
(under that site's boundaries) instead of an effect compute:

```tsx
// WRONG — signal synced by an effect; organizer() errors bypass the read site's <Errored>
const [signInError, setSignInError] = createSignal<string | null>(null);
createEffect(
  () => organizer(),
  (id) => {
    if (id !== null) setSignInError(null);
  },
);

// CORRECT — writable derivation: resets when organizer() changes; the setter still works
const [signInError, setSignInError] = createSignal<string | null>(() => {
  organizer();
  return null;
});
```

### Async data — fetch high, block low

Creating and reading an async value are the same as sync. **Consuming** (the
await) is a DX choice; **blocking** (the boundary) is a UX choice. Solid
unwelds them: where you create the memo is performance, where `<Loading>`
wraps the *read* is design, and neither is an architecture decision. JSX
component props are lazy (**passing isn't reading**), so intermediates do
not wait. Nested components mount immediately — they do not suspend — so
their fetches run in parallel. Making a value remote should touch the memo
and the boundary, not every file on the path, and should not change prop
types to `Promise<User>` or `Accessor<User>`.

```tsx
import { Errored, Loading, createMemo, createSignal, isPending } from 'solid-js';

function App() {
  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = createSignal(1);
  const story = createMemo(() => fetchStory(selectedId())); // fetch high

  return (
    <Errored fallback={(error, reset) => <ErrorFallback error={error} reset={reset} />}>
      {/* Default: highlight holds with the old content (consistent UI). */}
      <StoryList selectedId={selectedId()} onSelect={setSelectedId} />
      <main class={{ pending: isPending(selectedId) }}>
        <Loading fallback={<DetailSkeleton />}> {/* block low — the read, not chrome */}
          <StoryDetail story={story()} storyId={selectedId()} />
        </Loading>
      </main>
    </Errored>
  );
}

function StoryDetail(props: { story: Story; storyId: number }) {
  // Colorless derivation: no await, no Promise type. The memo becomes async itself.
  const byline = () => `${props.story.author} · ${props.story.points} points`;
  return (
    <article class={{ stale: isPending(() => props.story) }}>
      <h1>{props.story.title}</h1>
      <p>{byline()}</p>
      <Comments storyId={props.storyId} />
    </article>
  );
}
```

`story()` is a `Story`, not `Story | undefined` — if the computation is running,
the value is there. No `?.`, no `!`. `<StoryDetail story={story()} />` is the
correct colorless form: the prop expression is a getter, so `StoryDetail` (and
every layout in between) renders immediately. The wait happens when
`props.story.title` is read, under that `<Loading>`.

```tsx
// WRONG — extracting at the parent is a real read; child's <Loading> never sees it
const current = story();
return <StoryDetail story={current} />;

// WRONG — Promise / Accessor types on the path. Making story remote is not a
// type change for StoryLayout / StoryDetail.
function StoryDetail(props: { story: Promise<Story> }) { /* ... */ }
function StoryDetail(props: { story: Accessor<Story> }) { /* ... */ }

// Fine — pass the memo itself only when the child must refresh() that source.
// isPending / latest are questions: they work on the value prop too.
return <StoryDetail story={story} />;
```

- The `<Loading>` boundary must be an owner ancestor of the **read**, not of
  where the memo was created, and not of page chrome (header/nav) that should stay mounted.
  Lifting the fetch does **not** mean lifting the boundary — that is consume glued
  back onto block. After first paint the
  boundary keeps settled content during refetch; `isPending(results)` (pass the accessor,
  not `isPending(results())`) is the indicator. Use `on={query()}` (the **value**, not the
  accessor `on={query}`) only when that identity should put the fallback back on screen.
  Do not use `isPending` as the first-load spinner.
- **Nesting is not a waterfall.** `Comments` above fetches in parallel with `story`
  because it reads `props.storyId` (already known), not `props.story`. Passing
  `storyId={props.story.id}` *would* wait on the story fetch — that is a real data
  dependency, same as `createMemo(() => fetchAuthor(story().authorId))`. Components
  do not suspend; they run once. Only the expressions that read wait, so a parent
  JSX read does not delay a child that does not need that value.
- `isPending` is a **per-expression question**, not state and not a global spinner.
  Ask it anywhere: on the async source (`isPending(results)`), below it
  (`isPending(() => props.story)`), on a derived memo (`isPending(byline)`), or
  *above* the fetch but below the write (`isPending(selectedId)`), even when the
  fetch lives in a child. You do not need to pass the memo accessor just to ask.
- Default navigation **holds**. `selectedId()` and the old story stay put until
  the new answer lands, so the highlight never points at the wrong content.
  `latest(selectedId)` is the opt-in when the design wants the highlight to move
  on click. Pair `class={{ pending: isPending(selectedId) }}` with a short CSS
  `transition-delay` so fast swaps do not flash.
- Read every reactive input **before the first `await`** in an async computation. A read
  after `await` does not subscribe; production can sit pending with no retry.
- `<Errored>` function fallbacks receive an error **accessor** and a `reset` callback:
  `fallback={(error, reset) => ...}`. The boundary **heals** when the source succeeds
  again (refresh, live reconnect, input change) — it is graph status, not a terminal
  React ErrorBoundary. `reset` retries the collected *data sources*, not a UI remount.
- Refetch: `refresh(results)`. In-flight indicator: `isPending(results)` (or
  `isPending(() => results())`). Freshest in-flight value for a preview:
  `latest(results)`. Do not start `fetch` at component-body top level.
- Coordinate sibling `<Loading>` reveal with `<Reveal>` (`order="sequential"` default,
  or `"together"` / `"natural"`). `collapsed` (sequential only) suppresses tail
  skeletons past the frontier so the page does not stack fallbacks as popcorn.

**Never hand-roll these states.** No `[loading, setLoading]` signal, no
`data() === undefined` branch, no `{ data, error }` signal pair — those are React/Solid 1.x
reflexes that bypass the async model and `solid2-kit check` flags them. If a value is async,
make it an async computation and read it under boundaries. Refetching is `refresh(source)`
(typically as the last step of a mutation `action`, or a reload button) — never a
counter/version signal read inside the computation to force re-runs; input-driven refetch is
already automatic.

**Normalize thrown values once.** Thrown values are `unknown` in JavaScript, so define one
shared `ErrorFallback` component per app — extract the message via `instanceof Error`, wire
`reset` to a Retry affordance — and pass it to every `<Errored fallback>`, instead of
repeating `String(error())` at each boundary:

```tsx
<Errored fallback={(error, reset) => <ErrorFallback error={error} reset={reset} />}>
```

### Streams and subscriptions (websockets, reactive clients)

Push-based sources integrate by returning an **async iterable** from a computation — reads
then suspend to `<Loading>` until the first value, later pushes update the settled value,
and thrown errors reach `<Errored>`. Integration layers should return a plain accessor, not
`{ data, error }` signals:

```tsx
import { createMemo, onCleanup } from 'solid-js';

function createSubscriptionQuery<T>(
  subscribe: (next: (value: T) => void, fail: (error: unknown) => void) => () => void,
) {
  const queue: T[] = [];
  let failure: unknown;
  let wake = () => {};
  // Custom primitive: unsubscribe is tied to the caller's owner via onCleanup.
  // Component bodies use onSettled and return cleanup instead.
  onCleanup(subscribe(
    (value) => { queue.push(value); wake(); },
    (error) => { failure = error; wake(); },
  ));

  return createMemo(() => (async function* () {
    while (true) {
      if (failure !== undefined) throw failure;
      if (queue.length > 0) { yield queue.shift() as T; continue; }
      await new Promise<void>((resolve) => { wake = resolve; });
    }
  })());
}
```

Server-function `live()` sources are the same shape (async iterable → memo). Connection
state is `source.onstatus` (`"connected"` / `"reconnecting"` / `"closed"`), not a field
in the yielded value — see [Server functions](#server-functions--use-server).

### Mutations: `action` + optimistic state

The synchronous mutation *is* the prediction. Optimistic UI is not a second copy of
state — it is an overlay the graph discards when the action settles (pass or fail).
There is no rollback to write. Put in-flight affordances on the record
(`pending?: boolean`); they vanish with the overlay.

```tsx
import { action, createOptimisticStore, refresh } from 'solid-js';

type Todo = { id: string; title: string; completed: boolean; pending?: boolean; error?: { completed: boolean } };

function createTodos() { // call from a component — not module scope (SSR shares modules)
  const errors = new Map<string, { completed: boolean }>();
  const [todos, setTodos] = createOptimisticStore<Todo[]>(async () => {
    const current = await api.list();
    return current.map((todo) => {
      const error = errors.get(todo.id);
      return error ? { ...todo, error } : todo;
    });
  }, []);

  const toggleTodo = action(function* (id: string, completed: boolean) {
    setTodos((draft) => {
      const todo = draft.find((row) => row.id === id);
      if (!todo) return;
      todo.completed = completed;
      todo.pending = true;
    });
    try {
      yield api.toggle(id, completed);
      errors.delete(id);
    } catch {
      errors.set(id, { completed }); // survives overlay discard; do not throw to <Errored>
    } finally {
      refresh(todos);
    }
  });
  return [todos, { toggleTodo }] as const;
}
// invoke from an event handler: onClick={() => void toggleTodo(id, checked)}
```

Three layers, in this order: durable source → ephemeral UI that must survive
rollback (the `errors` map, folded in the projection) → optimistic overlay
(`pending`, the predicted `completed`). Consumers read one store. Catch
*expected* mutation failures in the action so a toggle error does not blank the
list through `<Errored>`; unhandled projection/render errors still reach the
boundary.

Going from a client store to the server is **additive**: same `setTodos`
calls, wrap each mutation in `action`, swap in `createOptimisticStore` and a
file of server functions. Do not rewrite `App.tsx` with loading/error branches,
do not snapshot-the-cache / write-a-prediction / restore-on-error, and do not
introduce a cache library to "make it real". The sync mutation already was the
prediction. Optimistic rows stay interactive — a not-yet-acked todo can still
be toggled. Do not disable the control until confirmation, and do not mutex
rapid clicks; `action` is the transaction (no half-mutation, no interleaved
list). An in-flight action does not freeze unrelated writes. Collecting failed
actions to replay is a design choice, not something the runtime requires.

Ordinary signal/store writes inside an action are held until it settles. Never call
`flush()` inside an action. Invoke actions from handlers, not from component/computation bodies.
Do not set a `submitted` signal and watch it from an effect — that work belongs in the
handler or the `action`.

`createOptimistic` / `createOptimisticStore` are for a tentative value during an
active mutation, not a local editing session (use a writable derivation or a plain
store for that). A whole-form `createOptimistic(false)` saving flag is fine; prefer
`pending` on the record when the affordance is per item. The overlay is still the
source of truth after you wrap the same store in server functions — do not add
snapshot/restore or a cache library "to make it production."

**`yield`, not a bare `await`, is the transaction boundary.** `await api.save()` then
`setTodos(...)` *runs*, but the write commits immediately and optimistic rollback is lost.
Either `yield saveTodo(todo)` or, when you need a typed result, `const saved = await api.save(); yield; setTodos(...)`.

Navigation-shaped updates do **not** need core `action`. A plain setter is enough:
reads pull the async, and downstream async computeds hold previous values until the
new ones are ready (`isPending` / `latest`). Reach for `action` from `solid-js` only
when writes happen *after* async work. Router form `action` from `@solidjs/router` is
a different API (URL + POST) — see [App stack](#app-stack-only-if-the-project-has-these-packages).

### Lists: `<For>` child signatures per keying mode

```tsx
// Default (keyed by item reference): item is the RAW value, index is an accessor
<For each={todos()}>{(todo, index) => <Row todo={todo} n={index()} />}</For>

// Key function: BOTH are accessors
<For each={todos()} keyed={(todo) => todo.id}>{(todo) => <Row todo={todo()} />}</For>

// Positional (Solid 1.x <Index>): item is an accessor, index is a plain number
<For each={cells()} keyed={false}>{(cell, i) => <Cell value={cell()} at={i} />}</For>
```

Choosing the keying mode:

| Where the rows come from | Mode |
|---|---|
| Server/refetched data — fetch results, subscription payloads (fresh object references on every update) | **key function on a stable id** (`keyed={(item) => item.id}`) — reference keying would recreate every row on each update |
| Local array whose item identities are stable (e.g. store rows, static lists) | default (item reference) |
| Fixed positions where only contents change | `keyed={false}` |

Never `{todos().map((t) => <Row todo={t} />)}` and never `<For each={todos().map(...)}>`.
The `.map` form *renders*; it just rebuilds every row. `children().toArray().map` is
fine — those nodes are already resolved.

`<Repeat from={start()} count={20}>{(index) => ...}</Repeat>` renders by absolute index with
no array diffing — use for fixed slot counts and virtual scrolling windows.

### Conditionals

Ternaries work and are reactive, but **when the truthy branch reads the tested value, use
`<Show>`**: its function child receives a narrowed accessor, so no non-null assertion is
needed. Never write `value()!` to narrow by hand (`solid2-kit check` flags it):

```tsx
// WRONG — hand narrowing with a non-null assertion
{error() ? <p>{error()!.message}</p> : <TaskList />}

// CORRECT — Show narrows; fallback holds the other branch
<Show when={error()} fallback={<TaskList />}>
  {(err) => <p>{err().message}</p>}
</Show>
```

```tsx
<Show when={user()} fallback={<SignIn />}>
  {(currentUser) => <Profile user={currentUser()} />} {/* narrowed ACCESSOR */}
</Show>
```

Plain ternaries remain fine when no narrowing is involved (`{open() ? <A /> : <B />}`).

Default `Show` keeps children mounted across truthy changes. Add `keyed` to remount when the
value's identity changes (child then receives the raw value, like React's `key` reset).
Prefer the default; use `keyed` only when internal state must reset. Multi-branch:
`<Switch>` / `<Match>` — **first truthy `<Match>` wins**; later matches are skipped,
even if they are also truthy.

Components must **return once**: never early-return based on a reactive value — the branch
is picked at setup and frozen. Early returns on non-reactive values (build-time config, a
missing environment variable) are fine.

### Input filtering (inputs do not rewind)

React's controlled inputs force the DOM back to the state value on every re-render, so
"ignore invalid keystrokes" works by simply not updating state. Solid has no re-render:
`value={v()}` writes the DOM only when `v` changes, so rejected characters **stay visible**
unless you rewind the DOM yourself:

```tsx
<input
  value={v()}
  onInput={(event) => {
    if (/^\d*$/.test(event.currentTarget.value)) setV(event.currentTarget.value);
    else event.currentTarget.value = v(); // reject: explicit write-back
  }}
/>
```

### Context

```tsx
import { createContext, createSignal, useContext } from 'solid-js';
import type { Accessor, ParentProps, Setter } from 'solid-js';

type Theme = 'light' | 'dark';

const ThemeContext = createContext<{ theme: Accessor<Theme>; setTheme: Setter<Theme> }>();

function ThemeProvider(props: ParentProps) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = createSignal<Theme>('light');
  return <ThemeContext value={{ theme, setTheme }}>{props.children}</ThemeContext>;
}

function ThemeButton() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext); // destructuring here is FINE
  return <button onClick={() => setTheme('dark')}>{theme()}</button>;
}
```

Pass accessors/setters/stores through context — never `value={theme()}` (a dead snapshot).
No `useMemo` for the value object, no context splitting: the object is created once and
fine-grained updates flow through the signals inside it. Context is **subtree scoping**.
A true app-wide singleton (theme, session, locale) is a module-level signal/store —
do not invent a root provider for that. Module state is shared across SSR requests.

### Refs

```tsx
import { onSettled, type Ref } from 'solid-js';

function listen(type: string, handler: EventListener, options?: AddEventListenerOptions) {
  let element: HTMLElement | undefined;
  onSettled(() => {
    const target = element;
    if (!target) return;
    target.addEventListener(type, handler, options);
    return () => target.removeEventListener(type, handler, options);
  });
  return (next: HTMLElement) => { element = next; };
}

function SearchField(props: { ref?: Ref<HTMLInputElement>; onInput: EventListener }) {
  let input!: HTMLInputElement;
  return (
    <>
      <input
        ref={[props.ref, (el) => (input = el), listen('input', props.onInput, { passive: true })]}
        type="search"
      />
      <button type="button" onClick={() => input.select()}>Select</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Ref arrays flatten recursively; each callback runs in order. No `forwardRef` needed.

**Ref callbacks run untracked and without an owner.** Their return values are
ignored — do not create effects, memos, or `onCleanup` inside the callback, and
do not `return () => cleanup`. Put owned setup in a **directive factory** (like
`listen` above) and return only the element callback. Use this for
`ResizeObserver`, third-party widgets, and native listener options (`capture` /
`passive`) — Solid event props do not take those options.

## Scheduling and tests

Signal/store writes outside a synchronous flush scope are **staged**; the reactive queue
commits on the next microtask. Event handlers need nothing. Tests must flush:

```ts
setCount(2);
flush();
expect(count()).toBe(2);
```

Wait for an async expression to settle in tests: `await resolve(() => value())`.
`flush()` only drains staged **synchronous** writes — it is not a stand-in for waiting
on a pending resource. `onSettled` is also a **single** fire (untracked): it is not
`onMount` that re-runs, and it is not an effect. Run tests in dev mode first — Solid 2 emits diagnostics for top-level reactive reads,
writes from owned scopes, and async reads outside `<Loading>`. Fix them; don't suppress.

Component tests use `@solidjs/testing-library`. Pass a **function** to `render` so
the tree has an owner, and `flush()` after interactions that stage writes:

```tsx
import { cleanup, fireEvent, render } from '@solidjs/testing-library';
import { flush } from 'solid-js';
import { afterEach, expect, test } from 'vitest';

afterEach(cleanup);

test('increments on click', () => {
  const { getByRole } = render(() => <Counter />);
  const button = getByRole('button');
  fireEvent.click(button);
  flush();
  expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Clicks: 1');
});
```

`jsxImportSource` for tests and app code is `"@solidjs/web"`, not `"solid-js"`.
Vite plugin is `@solidjs/vite-plugin`, not `vite-plugin-solid`.

To turn those dev diagnostics into a hard gate, patch `console.warn` in the test setup
file to rethrow unexpected warnings — then any top-level reactive read or unowned write
an agent sneaks in fails the suite instead of scrolling by.

## Client mode: no server HTML, no hydration reflexes

The `@solidjs/vite-plugin` default (client mode, the `bare` tier) serves an empty-body
shell and mounts with `render()`. Nothing is server-rendered and nothing hydrates, so
**React's hydration-mismatch playbook does not transfer**: do not start signals with a
"server-safe" initial value and adopt `localStorage` / `matchMedia` after mount, do not
two-pass render, and there is no `suppressHydrationWarning`. Read client sources directly
when creating state — `createSignal(storedPreference())` is correct in client mode. A
deferred "safe" initial value is worse than unnecessary: if anything persists the value
(an effect writing `localStorage`), the placeholder **overwrites the user's stored
preference** before the real value is adopted. Mismatch only becomes a concept in
start/SSR mode, where `hydrate()` mounts onto server HTML — and the Solid answer there is
`isServer` / `clientOnly`, still not React-style deferred adoption.

## App stack (only if the project has these packages)

This kit's always-applied rules cover `solid-js` + `@solidjs/web` TSX. Official
Solid 2 docs also describe optional app layers. **If those packages are in the
project, use them — do not invent Next.js, React Router, SolidStart 1.x, or
Solid Router 0.x/1.x stand-ins.** Patterns below; fetch the matching pages from
[references/official-docs.md](references/official-docs.md).

### Compiler / packages

```json
{ "compilerOptions": { "jsx": "preserve", "jsxImportSource": "@solidjs/web" } }
```

`solid-js` does **not** export a `JSX` namespace — `import type { JSX } from "solid-js"`
is a type error (TS2305), and `JSX.Element` as the children type is a React reflex.
Children/return types are the renderer-neutral `Element` from `solid-js`
(`children?: Element`), alongside `Component` / `ParentProps` / `Accessor` / `Setter`.
DOM-specific `JSX` types (`JSX.IntrinsicElements`, `JSX.CSSProperties`) and
`ComponentProps` come from `@solidjs/web`. Vite: `import solid from "@solidjs/vite-plugin"`
with `start: true` / `ssr: true` / `serverFunctions: true` only when the
project already uses start mode. Tiers are `bare` → `basic` (router) →
`fullstack` (SSR + server functions); do not jump a tier without cause.
Under `start: true` the plugin owns entries, the document shell, and the build —
write `src/App.tsx`, not SolidStart-style `entry-client.tsx` / `entry-server.tsx`
or a hand-written `index.html`.

### Solid Router 2 — `createRouter`, not JSX `<Route>`

```tsx
import { lazy } from 'solid-js';
import { createRouter } from '@solidjs/router';

export const Router = createRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/', component: lazy(() => import('./pages/Home')) },
    { path: '/about', component: lazy(() => import('./pages/About')) },
    { path: '*404', component: lazy(() => import('./pages/NotFound')) },
  ],
});
export const { paths } = Router;

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      {(props) => (
        <>
          <a href={Router.paths()}>Home</a>
          <main>{props.children}</main>
        </>
      )}
    </Router>
  );
}
```

Create the instance at **module scope**. Nested layouts are `children` arrays
on the route objects, not nested `<Route>` / nested routers. Solid Router does
**not** support nested `<Router>` instances — compose one route tree (or a lazy
`children` thunk). Navigate with
plain `<a href={Router.paths.about}>` (or `useNavigate`); there is no `<A>` /
`<Navigate>` / `<HashRouter>` / `<FileRoutes />`. Do not assign
`window.location.href` or call `history.pushState` for in-app navigation.
Session location is `useLocation` / `useParams`,
not `Router.paths`. A route `preload` result is `props.data` on the matched
component (and the factory `preload` result is the root render prop's `props.data`).
Link warming: `preload="false"` skips that link's *data* preload; `preloadLinks: false`
disables automatic link preloading. Intent values are `"initial"` / `"navigate"` /
`"native"` / `"preload"`. One router per app.

**Two different `action`s.** Core `action` from `solid-js` is a generator transaction
(optimistic writes that span an async gap). Router `action` from `@solidjs/router` is
a URL-addressable POST mutation (`useSubmissions`, `<form action={save} method="post">`).
Do not import one and use it as the other.

```tsx
import { action } from '@solidjs/router';
import { redirect } from '@solidjs/web';

const save = action(async (form: FormData) => {
  await saveProfile(form);
  return redirect('/account');
}, 'update-profile');

<form action={save} method="post">
  <input name="displayName" />
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

Only POST forms are accepted. Bind extra args with `.with(id)` (they go in the
action URL). `onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); fetch(...) }}` *runs* and
drops the no-JS form fallback. `useAction` is JS-only for the same reason.

**`query` is the read cache** (optional, only with the router). Wrap a read,
give it a stable name, and consume it through a Solid async primitive:

```tsx
import { createMemo } from 'solid-js';
import { query, revalidate } from '@solidjs/router';

export const getUser = query(async (id: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
  return response.json();
}, 'users');

const user = createMemo(() => getUser(params.id));
// after a mutation:
revalidate(getUser.key);
revalidate(getUser.keyFor('42'));
```

A bare `createMemo(async () => fetchUser(id()))` still works; it just has no
shared cache, no preload reuse, and no `revalidate`. Do not wrap mutations in
`query` — wrapping an undeclared server function makes it GET. `query.get(key)`
throws if there is no entry; `query.set` does not accept a promise. Cache is
request-scoped on the server and application-scoped in the browser. After a
router mutation, `revalidate(...)` — not core `refresh()`, and not
`reload()` (that is a *server-function return* that asks the integration to
refresh cached data: `return reload({ revalidate: "todos" })`). `live()` sources
update through the open stream; do not `revalidate` them. Replace SolidStart /
Router 0.x leftovers: no `createAsync`, `useSubmission` (singular), `cache()`,
router `json()`, or `<FileRoutes />` (`fileRoutes(pageRoutes)` instead).

### Server functions — `"use server"`

```ts
export async function findUser(id: string) {
  'use server';
  // validate `id`; read identity from getRequestEvent(), never from arguments
  return database.users.find(id);
}
```

A function-level server function cannot close over component locals — pass
values as arguments. Treat every argument as untrusted — TypeScript does not
cross the HTTP boundary, so do not invent tRPC / a schema layer / type-gen;
validate inside the function. These functions *are* the RPC — do not add an
API-route file (or a Next `route.ts`) just to wrap `db.todos.insert`. API
routes are for real HTTP endpoints (webhooks, third-party POST), not for the
app talking to its own database. Read trusted identity
from `getRequestEvent()`, never from a caller-supplied user id. During SSR the same
reference runs in-process (no HTTP); in the browser it is HTTP. Anything
referenced only inside the `"use server"` body (db client, secrets) never
reaches the client — the directive is the privacy boundary. Mutations that should
revalidate: `redirect` / `reload` from `@solidjs/web` (see the server-function
guides). After a router/server mutation do **not** follow with a client `fetch`
to "refresh the page" — `reload` / `revalidate` (and the router's single-flight
response) close that loop. For 404 during SSR: `httpStatus(404)` from `@solidjs/web`.
`throw new Error("…")` is stripped to `"Internal Server Error"` in production —
use `markSafeError` or `respond(..., { status })` for intentional client-facing
failures. Do not `return Response.json(...)` from `"use server"` — that is
HTTP-handler control flow; `respond(value, { status })` is what a scripted
caller unwraps. JSON-encodable arguments only unless `enableRichArguments()`
was called once in the client entry (`Date` / `Map` / `Set` throw without it).
`GET()` is only for idempotent reads (URLs leak into logs/history);
import it from `@solidjs/web/server-functions`, never `@solidjs/start`.
Cache GET reads with HTTP, not a hand-rolled Solid cache: the caller still
receives the value; headers ride the transport.

```ts
import { respond } from '@solidjs/web';
import { GET } from '@solidjs/web/server-functions';

export const fetchStory = GET(async (id: number) => {
  'use server';
  const story = await db.stories.find(id);
  return respond(story, {
    headers: { 'cache-control': 'public, max-age=60, s-maxage=300' },
  });
});
```

`live()` yields **current state** (each yield replaces the last); do not treat
it as an append-only event log. The first yield is the `<Loading>` boundary
(same as a Promise); later yields are updates — the fallback does not return.
Wire status is a side channel, not a field in the value:

```ts
source.onstatus = (next) => setStatus(next); // "connected" | "reconnecting" | "closed"
```

Do not yield `{ price, connected: true }`. After the first successful connection,
transient failures retry with exponential backoff; a 4xx is a definite rejection.
There is no subscription API and no store wiring to configure: one `createMemo(() => stockPrice(symbol()))` consumes, and every reader of that memo shares the latest value. Do not write subscribe/unsubscribe around `live()` — the memo owns the connection. Hoist the memo (or a router-level live query around that transport) so multiple readers share one stream.

**The graph continues across the wire.** An in-flight Promise serializes as a
Promise and resolves in the client graph as it settles — including before the
bundle has loaded. A `live()` source sends its first value in the HTML then
picks up the stream. Do not refetch in `onSettled` / `hydrate` to "load for the
client", and do not delay `renderToStream` to preserve visual order — `<Reveal>`
controls when content *appears*, while HTML still ships as soon as it is ready.
With the router's single-flight integration, a mutation response can seed the
destination route's preloads; that is the refresh, not a follow-up `fetch`.
Start-mode production is `handleRequest(request)` (or the default Fetchable
`fetch`). Cloudflare / Netlify / Nitro Vite plugins adopt that handler — do not
write a Solid adapter, a custom Worker, or a Netlify Function. For Node, use the
official template `server.js` (web `Request` in, stream the response); do not
invent an Express/Solid bridge. Request middleware is `start.middleware`
(web `Request` + `next`), not Express `app.use`. Server functions that return components
(`serverFunctions: { components: true }`) are experimental preview — do not use
them unless the project already has that flag on.

Unscripted forms: `<form method="post" action={createTodo.url}>` (the reference
`.url`), not a client `preventDefault` + `fetch`, and not a hand-built
`/_server/` URL. GET forms (`method="get" action={search.url}`) are only for
idempotent search — do not use a GET form for a mutation.

### Document head — no MetaProvider

```tsx
import { Title, Link, Meta } from '@solidjs/meta';

<Title>Page title</Title>
<Meta name="description" content="..." />
```

Solid Meta 1.x has **no provider**. Render tags anywhere; later wins, unmount
restores. `useHead` from `@solidjs/web` is the lower-level registry — prefer
`<Title>` / `<Meta>` / `<Script>` (JSON-LD) for application metadata. Several
tags that should swap as one unit belong in `<Head>`. A static `<title>`
in the document shell is the fallback when no `<Title>` is mounted; do not
hardcode a second `<meta name="description">` (the registry leaves foreign tags
alone, so both would coexist). Do not hardcode a second `<title>` in the document shell.

## These still run — write the other form

Official docs (and the compiler) allow several of these. They are the wrong
tool: they snapshot, drop subscriptions, or rebuild work Solid already knows
how to reuse. Prefer the form on the right.

| Compiles / renders | Write this |
|---|---|
| `{todos().map((t) => <Row todo={t} />)}` | `<For each={todos()} keyed={(t) => t.id}>` |
| `<For each={todos().map(t => t)}>` | derive first, then `<For each={visible()}>` |
| `class={`btn ${on() ? "on" : ""}`}` / `clsx("btn", on() && "on")` / `.filter(Boolean).join(" ")` | `class={["btn", { on: on() }]}` |
| `style={{ width: 80 }}` (no unit) | `style={{ width: `${80}px` }}` |
| `const rest = { ...props }` | `const rest = omit(props, "label")` |
| `const user = createMemo(async () => { await fetch(...); return id(); })` | read `id()` **before** `await` |
| `action(async function* () { await save(); setX(v); })` | `yield save()` or `await save(); yield; setX(v)` |
| `todos()` on a store | `todos.length` / `todo.title` (property reads) |
| `setTodos((t) => t.filter((x) => x.ok))` | mutate the draft, or `reconcile` |
| `createEffect(() => user, (u) => log(u.name))` | `createEffect(() => user.name, (name) => log(name))` |
| `<Loading fallback={<PageSkeleton />}>{/* header + data */}</Loading>` | wrap only the data slot; chrome stays outside |
| `<Loading on={id} fallback={...}>` (the accessor) | `on={id()}` — a value, so identity changes can show fallback |
| `setCount(count() + 1)` when writes can batch | `setCount((c) => c + 1)` |
| `setHandler(fn)` to store a function | `setHandler(() => fn)` (otherwise `fn` is an updater) |
| `{user() ? <P user={user()!} /> : <SignIn />}` | `<Show when={user()}>{(u) => <P user={u()} />}</Show>` |
| `const u = user(); return <Child user={u} />` / `user: Promise<User>` / `user: Accessor<User>` as the default | `<Child user={user()} />` and `{props.user.name}` under `<Loading>` — types stay `User`. Pass the memo itself only when the child must `refresh()` that source. `isPending(() => props.user)` works on the value |
| `lazy(() => import("./p").then((m) => ({ default: m.About })))` | `lazy(() => import("./p"), { export: "About" })` |
| `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html }}` | `innerHTML={html()}` (sanitized); never with JSX children |
| `onClick={setCount}` | `onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}` |
| `event.target.value` | `event.currentTarget.value` |
| `createContext(emptyStore)` for reactive state | `createContext<Todos>()` — dummy defaults silently no-op |
| `<For keyed={(t) => t.id}>{(todo) => todo.title}` | `todo().title` — key-function items are accessors |
| `{list().length ? <For each={list()}> : <Empty />}` | `<For each={list()} fallback={<Empty />}>` |
| `<For each={rows.slice(from, from + n)}>` | `<Repeat from={from()} count={n}>` |
| `{count() && <Badge />}` | `<Show when={count()}>` — `0` must not render as text |
| `throw new Error("expired")` from a server function (prod) | `throw markSafeError(...)` or `throw respond(body, { status })` |
| `GET(async (id) => { "use server"; await db.delete(id) })` | mutations stay on POST; `GET()` is for idempotent reads |
| `live()` yields as an event log to append | each yield **replaces** the current answer; yield current state first |
| `<article innerHTML={html()}>…children…</article>` | `innerHTML` **or** children, not both |
| `fallback={(error) => <p>{error.message}</p>}` | `error` is an accessor: `error().message` (or `String(error())`) |
| `import { action } from "solid-js"` on a `<form>` | `import { action } from "@solidjs/router"` + `<form action={save} method="post">` (core `action` is a generator transaction, not a form URL) |
| `createMemo(async () => fetchUser(id()))` when `@solidjs/router` is present | `query(fetchUser, "users")` + `createMemo(() => getUser(id()))`; after mutations `revalidate(getUser.key)`, not core `refresh()` |
| `onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); fetch(...) }}` for a router/server action | `<form action={save} method="post">` (POST only; `.with(id)` binds args into the URL). `useAction` is JS-only |
| `query(saveUser, "users")` wrapping a mutation | don't wrap mutations in `query` — an undeclared server function becomes GET |
| `render(<App />, root)` / Testing Library `render(<Counter />)` | `render(() => <App />, root)` — pass a function so Solid creates the root first |
| `render` onto SSR HTML / `hydrate` into an empty node | `hydrate(() => <App />, root)` when HTML already exists; `render` for an empty mount |
| `renderToString(() => <App />)` for an async or lazy-route tree | `await renderToStream(() => <App />)` (one consumer: `pipe` / `pipeTo` / `readable`). String render emits `<Loading>` fallbacks |
| `clientOnly(() => import("./Map"))` for a rarely shown widget | same + `{ lazy: true }` so the import waits until first render (default starts at declaration) |
| `<NoHydration><Chart /></NoHydration>` to skip SSR of a widget | `clientOnly(() => import("./Chart"))` — `NoHydration`/`Hydration` split ownership, they do not choose visible content |
| `await flush()` / `flush()` to wait on a pending memo | `await resolve(() => value())` (or Testing Library async queries); `flush()` only drains staged *sync* writes |
| `action(function* () { setX(v); })` around a navigation-shaped setter | plain setter; async computeds hold previous values. Core `action` only when writes happen *after* async work |
| `createContext` + a root provider for a true app singleton | module-level signal/store (SSR: shared across requests). Context is subtree scoping |
| `import { GET } from "@solidjs/start"` / `createAsync` / `useSubmission` / `<FileRoutes />` / `"use client"` | `GET` from `@solidjs/web/server-functions`; `createMemo(() => getUser(id()))`; `useSubmissions`; `fileRoutes(pageRoutes)`; Solid has no `"use client"` |
| `<Show keyed when={user()}>` by default | default `Show` (keeps children mounted); `keyed` only when internal state must reset |
| overlapping truthy `<Match>`es all expected to render | first truthy `<Match>` wins; later matches are skipped |
| missing `<HydrationScript />` / one script for many roots | once, before app markup, when the app owns the document; distinct `renderId` per extra root |
| `Router.paths` as the current URL; calling `preload()` and using the return as props | `useLocation` / `useParams`; factory/route `preload` result is `props.data` |
| `query.get(key)` with no guaranteed entry; `query.set(key, promise)` | `query.get` throws if missing; `query.set` does not accept a promise |
| `onCleanup(() => ...)` in a component body | `onSettled(() => { ...; return cleanup })` — `onCleanup` is for custom primitives |
| `onSettled` with reactive reads expecting re-runs | each call is a **single** fire; reads are untracked. Ongoing work is `createEffect` |
| `<Router>` nested inside `<Router>` | one instance; nest `children` arrays (or a lazy children thunk) |
| `const View = tab() ? A : B; return <View />` | `const View = dynamic(() => (tab() ? A : B))` — the ternary at setup freezes the choice |
| `<For each={resolved()}>` after `children()` | `{resolved.toArray()}` — resolved children are not a reactive data list |
| `<input onChange={...}>` for keystrokes | `onInput` — native `onChange` is blur/commit |
| `createOptimistic` for a local edit draft | writable derivation / plain store. Optimistic is for an in-flight mutation |
| `createMemo(async fn, { loadingValue })` / `{ seedLoadingValue: true }` as the default first-flight UI | `<Loading>` for first flight; those options are escape hatches (store projections use `seedLoadingValue`) |
| `setSubmitted(true)` + an effect that watches it | do the work in the handler or an `action` |
| `findUser(userId)` with the id from the client as identity | `getRequestEvent()!.locals.userId` |
| `action={"/_server/" + id}` in app JSX | `action={createTodo.url}` or a router `action` |
| `<form method="get" action={update.url}>` for a mutation | GET forms only for idempotent search; mutations are POST |
| `window.location.href = ...` / `history.pushState` | `useNavigate()` or `<a href={Router.paths...}>` |
| `httpStatus(404)` in a click handler | call it bare in the component / error-fallback body (a scope declaration, not a mutation) |
| `try { user() } catch (e) { /* NotReadyError */ }` | `<Loading>` — app code should not catch `NotReadyError` |
| `{latest(() => results())}` as the visible list | settled read + `isPending()` for the indicator; `latest` is for previews |
| `selectedId={latest(selectedId)}` as the default highlight | `selectedId={selectedId()}` so highlight and content stay consistent; `latest` only when the highlight should move first |
| `isPending` on a root/global pending signal, or wrapping the whole shell | ask the question at the design site (dimmed list, disabled button, pane). It works on the source, a derived prop, or the write |
| `<Loading>` glued to the `createMemo` (consume + block in one place) | fetch high, block low — the boundary wraps the read, not the creation |
| `class={{ pending: isPending(id) }}` flashing on every navigation | same class + a short CSS `transition-delay` so only slow swaps show |
| `<Comments />` nested under `{story().title}` assumed to waterfall | both mount immediately and fetch in parallel if the child reads an already-known id; a real waterfall is `createMemo(() => fetchAuthor(story().authorId))` or `storyId={props.story.id}` |
| `<Errored>` as a terminal ErrorBoundary; `reset={() => location.reload()}` | the boundary heals when the source succeeds again; `reset` retries collected *sources*, not a UI remount |
| `<Errored>` around a list catching a toggle/save failure | catch expected mutation failures in the `action`; keep row errors in a map the projection folds in (survives overlay discard) |
| `yield { ...tick, connected: true }` from `live()` | yield the value; wire status is `source.onstatus` (`"connected"` / `"reconnecting"` / `"closed"`) |
| sibling `<Loading>` fallbacks stacking as popcorn | `<Reveal collapsed>` (sequential default) suppresses tail skeletons past the frontier |
| in-memory cache around a GET server function | `return respond(value, { headers: { "cache-control": "..." } })` — metadata rides HTTP, the value rides the graph |
| `story()?.title` / treating `story()` as `Story \| undefined` | `{story().title}` under `<Loading>` — if the computation is running, the value is there |
| `typeof window !== "undefined"` | `isServer` / `isDev` from `@solidjs/web` |
| `Object.assign({}, props)` / expecting `merge` to skip `undefined` like 1.x `mergeProps` | `omit` / `merge` — explicit `undefined` **overrides** (Object.assign) |
| `isPending(user())` / `latest(user())` | `isPending(user)` / `latest(user)` — pass the accessor (or `() => user()`). Calling it first evaluates the read before the helper runs |
| `isPending(...)` as the first-load spinner | `<Loading>` owns first flight; `isPending` is the *refetch* indicator after a settled answer exists |
| `refresh(getUser.key)` / `revalidate(user)` / `return refresh()` from `"use server"` | three APIs: core `refresh(source)` reruns a reactive source; router `revalidate(getUser.key)` invalidates the query cache; `return reload({ revalidate: "todos" })` asks the integration to refresh cached data |
| `revalidate(liveSource)` | `live()` updates through the open stream; do not revalidate it |
| `refresh(user)` without `affects` when the reload should look pending | pair `affects(user)` with `refresh(user)` — a bare `refresh` re-asks quietly |
| `<Dynamic component={tab() ? A : B} />` | `const View = dynamic(() => (tab() ? A : B))` — `<Dynamic>` is a JSX convenience; app code should use `dynamic()` for stable identity |
| `<meta name="description" content="...">` hardcoded in the document shell | `<Meta>` from `@solidjs/meta`. A static `<title>` is the fallback; other hardcoded tags coexist with the registry |
| `useHead({ tag: "meta", ... })` for ordinary page tags | `<Title>` / `<Meta>` / `<Script>` (JSON-LD). `useHead` is the lower-level registry |
| two `<Meta property="og:image">` meant as one replacement set | wrap them in `<Head>` — a later group replaces the earlier set as one unit |
| `createRoot(() => ...)` inside a component | let `render` / the component owner own the scope. `createRoot` is for tests, libraries, and non-render entry points |
| `JSON.stringify(store)` / `structuredClone(store)` | `snapshot(store)` — proxies throw or leak reactivity |
| `import { env } from "virtual:env/client"` (or `import.meta.env`) for a signing secret | `import { env } from "virtual:env/server"` — client map values are public |
| `renderToStream(...).pipe(res)` and also `.readable` / `await` on the same result | exactly one consumer: `pipe` / `pipeTo` / `readable` / await |
| `return Response.json(user, { status: 201 })` from `"use server"` | `return respond(user, { status: 201 })` — scripted callers receive `user`, not a `Response` |
| `<Portal>{user().name}</Portal>` for an async read | hoist the read above the portal (children start on the client); async UI inside one wants its own `<Loading>` |
| a client history adapter to pick the SSR location | `<Router url={request.url}>` (or the request event). Client adapters do not select the server URL |
| `fetch('/api')` at component-body top level | `createMemo(async () => { ... fetch ... })` under `<Loading>` — a top-level fetch runs once at mount and is not a reactive source |
| `<input type="checkbox" value={on()} />` | `checked={on()}` for the toggle; `value="string"` only when grouping radios or listing submitted values |
| `createMemo(() => { void save(); return x(); })` / an effect that calls an action | invoke actions from handlers, not from memos or effects |
| `createSignal(props.value)` / `createStore(props.items)` | `createSignal(() => props.value)` / `createStore(() => props.items, fallback)` — a bare `props.x` at setup is a snapshot |
| `createRenderEffect` / `createTrackedEffect` as the default effect | two-phase `createEffect(compute, apply)` |
| `createEffect(() => source(), () => setError(null))` to reset a signal | `createSignal(() => { source(); return null; })` — the writable derivation resets on change; a sole-setter apply is rule 4 |
| a "server-safe" initial value adopted after mount (React hydration-mismatch fix) | client mode mounts with `render()` into an empty body — no hydration, no mismatch; read `localStorage` / `matchMedia` directly at signal creation |
| rewrite `App.tsx` with loading/error branches, snapshot/restore, or a cache library when the list moves to the server | same `setTodos`; wrap mutations in `action`; swap `createOptimisticStore` + a server-functions file. The overlay stays the source of truth |
| disable an optimistic row until ack, or mutex rapid clicks / freeze unrelated writes | keep the control enabled; `action` is the transaction. An in-flight action does not freeze other writes. Failed-action replay is optional |
| tRPC / type-gen / a schema layer around `"use server"` | TypeScript does not cross HTTP — validate inside the function. Locals only the body reads (db, secrets) stay off the client |
| `src/routes/api/todos.ts` (or a Next `route.ts`) wrapping `db.todos.insert` | `"use server"` *is* the RPC. API routes are for real HTTP endpoints (webhooks), not the app's own mutations |
| router/server mutation, then `fetch` / `onSettled` / `hydrate` to refresh the page | `reload` / `revalidate` / single-flight (the mutation response can seed destination preloads). In-flight Promises serialize as Promises; `live()` continues from HTML |
| delay `renderToStream` so HTML arrives in visual order | stream as soon as ready; `<Reveal collapsed>` controls when content *appears* |
| subscribe/unsubscribe (or a store wiring) around `live()` | `createMemo(() => stockPrice(symbol()))` — the memo owns the connection. First yield is `<Loading>`; later yields are updates |
| a Solid adapter / custom Worker / Express bridge, or `entry-client.tsx` under `start: true` | `handleRequest(request)` / Fetchable `fetch`; platform plugins adopt it. Node: template `server.js`. Start mode: write `src/App.tsx`. Middleware is `start.middleware`, not Express `app.use` |
| `createMemo(async () => (await props.story).author)` | `createMemo(() => props.story.author)` — a derivation over an async value becomes async; no await, no Promise type |
| return a component from `"use server"` / flip `serverFunctions.components` | experimental preview — do not enable unless the project already has that flag |

```tsx
// WRONG — post-await read never subscribes; production can hang pending
const user = createMemo(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/me');
  const extra = flag(); // too late
  return { ...(await response.json()), extra };
});

// CORRECT
const user = createMemo(async () => {
  const extra = flag();
  const response = await fetch('/api/me');
  return { ...(await response.json()), extra };
});
```

```tsx
// WRONG — rest is a plain object snapshot
function Field(props: { label: string; class?: string }) {
  const rest = { ...props };
  return <label>{props.label}<input {...rest} /></label>;
}

// CORRECT
function Field(props: { label: string; class?: string }) {
  const rest = omit(props, 'label');
  return <label>{props.label}<input {...rest} /></label>;
}
```

```tsx
// WRONG — extracting at the parent is a real read; child's <Loading> never sees it
function Page() {
  const user = createMemo(async () => (await fetch('/api/me')).json());
  const current = user();
  return <Profile user={current} />;
}

// CORRECT — JSX props are lazy (passing isn't reading); types stay User
function Profile(props: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <Loading fallback={<p>Loading…</p>}>
      <h1>{props.user.name}</h1>
    </Loading>
  );
}
function Page() {
  const user = createMemo(async () => (await fetch('/api/me')).json());
  return <Profile user={user()} />;
}
```

```tsx
// WRONG — two different `action`s; the core one is not a form URL
import { action } from 'solid-js';
const save = action(async function* (form: FormData) {
  yield persist(form);
});
<form onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); void save(new FormData(e.currentTarget)); }}>
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>

// CORRECT — router action is POST-addressable (only if `@solidjs/router` is in the project)
import { action } from '@solidjs/router';
const save = action(async (form: FormData) => persist(form), 'save');
<form action={save} method="post">
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

```tsx
// WRONG — evaluating JSX before the root exists
import { render } from '@solidjs/web';
render(<App />, document.getElementById('app')!);

// CORRECT
render(() => <App />, document.getElementById('app')!);
```

```tsx
// WRONG — user() runs before isPending, so the helper never sees the accessor
<article aria-busy={isPending(user())}>{user().name}</article>

// CORRECT — pass the accessor (or () => user()); <Loading> still owns first flight
<Loading fallback={<p>Loading…</p>}>
  <article aria-busy={isPending(user) ? 'true' : 'false'}>{user().name}</article>
</Loading>
```

```tsx
// WRONG — tab() is read once at setup; View never changes
const View = tab() ? Detailed : Compact;
return <View value="now" />;

// CORRECT
const View = dynamic(() => (tab() ? Detailed : Compact));
return <View value="now" />;
```

## Review checklist (before finishing any TSX change)

- [ ] No props destructuring; no `props.` at component-body top level.
- [ ] Every reactive read (`signal()`, `props.x`, `store.x`) sits in JSX, a memo, an effect
      compute, or a boundary — not the component body.
- [ ] No signal-synced-by-effect; derived values are functions or memos. Reset-on-change
      is a writable derivation (`createSignal(() => { source(); return initial; })`), not
      an effect calling the setter.
- [ ] Event handlers wrap setters (`onClick={() => setX(...)}`), use `currentTarget`,
      and `onInput` for keystrokes. `innerHTML` is sanitized and not mixed with children.
- [ ] Async memos are passed as values (`user={user()}`); JSX props are lazy.
      Types stay `User` — not `Promise<User>` / `Accessor<User>`. `<Loading>` wraps
      the *read*, not the memo, not chrome. Extracting `const u = user()` at the
      parent is the read that throws. Nested child fetches run in parallel
      (components do not suspend); a real waterfall is `fetchB(a().id)`.
      `isPending` is per-expression (`isPending(() => props.story)` works);
      `latest(selectedId)` is opt-in, not the default highlight.
- [ ] Lists via `<For>` (server/refetched rows keyed by stable id), conditionals via
      ternary/`<Show>`; no `{list().map(...)}` in JSX; no `key` props; no `value()!`.
- [ ] Effects are two-phase and only at imperative boundaries; apply does not read stores.
- [ ] Async reads sit under `<Loading>` (the data slot, not chrome); errors under `<Errored>`.
      Reactive inputs of an async memo are read before the first `await`. No hand-rolled
      `loading`/`error` signals or `=== undefined` readiness branches. First load is
      `<Loading>`; refetch indicator is `isPending(user)` (the accessor, not `user()`)
      or `isPending(selectedId)` when the write is the question. `<Errored>` heals
      when the source succeeds; `reset` retries sources, not a UI remount. Per-row
      mutation failures stay in the action/projection, not in `<Errored>` around
      the list. Core `refresh(source)`, router `revalidate(key)`, and `return reload(...)` are
      different APIs — do not mix them. Client → server is additive (same
      setters + `action` + server functions): do not rewrite App with
      loading/error branches, disable optimistic rows until ack, or refetch in
      `hydrate` / `onSettled`. HTTP does not enforce TypeScript — validate
      inside `"use server"`; do not invent tRPC. `live()` owns the connection.
      Start-mode production is `handleRequest` / Fetchable `fetch`, not a custom
      adapter. Do not delay `renderToStream` for visual order (`<Reveal>` does).
- [ ] External collections reconcile into stores (function-form `createStore` /
      `reconcile`), never wholesale draft assignment or `setTodos((t) => t.filter(...))`
      as the identity-preserving update.
- [ ] Rest props via `omit`, not `{ ...props }`. Conditional `class` via objects, not string concat.
- [ ] Input filters write back to the DOM on reject (inputs do not rewind).
- [ ] No Solid 1.x imports or APIs (`solid-js/store`, `createResource`, `onMount`, `Suspense`, ...).
      No `JSX` imported from `solid-js` — children/return types are `Element` from
      `solid-js`; DOM `JSX` types come from `@solidjs/web`.
- [ ] Inspect children with `children()`; code-split with `lazy` + `<Loading>`; reactive
      component choice with `dynamic()`. No `React.lazy`, no effects inside ref callbacks.
- [ ] Browser-only code uses `isServer` / `clientOnly`, not `typeof window`.
      Component teardown is `onSettled` (return cleanup), not `onCleanup`.
- [ ] If the project has a router: `createRouter({ routes })`, not JSX `<Route>` / `<A>`.
      One instance, no nested `<Router>`. Navigate with `useNavigate` / `<a href>`, not
      `window.location`. Router `action`/`query` come from `@solidjs/router` (POST forms + cache), not
      core `action`/`refresh`. Forms: `<form action={save} method="post">`.
- [ ] `render(() => <App />, root)` — a function, not `render(<App />)`. `hydrate` when
      HTML already exists. Stream async/lazy trees (`await renderToStream(...)`) with
      exactly one consumer (`pipe` / `pipeTo` / `readable`). Snapshot stores with
      `snapshot(store)`, not `JSON.stringify`. Secrets live in `virtual:env/server`.
- [ ] `jsxImportSource` is `@solidjs/web`; Vite plugin is `@solidjs/vite-plugin`.
      No `@solidjs/start`, `vinxi`, `"use client"`, or Next.js imports.
- [ ] Single return per component; no early returns on reactive conditions.
- [ ] `solid2-kit check` and the project's typecheck pass; `solid2-kit doctor` too if
      `package.json`, tsconfig, or root config files changed.
