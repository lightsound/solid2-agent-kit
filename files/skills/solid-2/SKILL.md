# Writing Solid 2.0

This project uses Solid 2.0 (`solid-js` 2.x) with `@solidjs/web`. The hard rules are
installed by solid2-agent-kit as an always-applied rules file (`.cursor/rules/solid-2.mdc`
for Cursor; a managed block in `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code). This skill adds the mental
model, decision tables, and canonical patterns. When an API is in doubt, verify against the
official docs — see [Checking the official docs](#checking-the-official-docs).

## The one difference everything follows from

React re-runs component functions to compute the next UI. **Solid runs a component function
once, at mount.** After that, signals and stores notify only the computations and JSX
expressions that read them. There is no re-render, no reconciliation of component output,
no snapshot props, no stale closures, no dependency arrays.

Practical consequences:

- Values must travel as **accessors (functions)**, not as extracted values. Extracting a
  value at component-body top level freezes it forever.
- The component body is **untracked**. Tracking scopes are: JSX expressions, `createMemo`
  compute, `createEffect` compute (first argument), and boundary children.
- Event handlers run untracked: they always read current values and never subscribe.
- Object identity is stable: handlers, context values, and props objects are created once.
  `useCallback` / `useMemo`-for-identity / `React.memo` have no purpose here.

## Decision tables

### Where does state live?

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Scalar local state (count, open/closed, text input) | `createSignal(value)` in the component |
| Object/array state where parts update independently (forms, lists, nested data) | `createStore(value)` — property-level subscriptions |
| Object that is replaced wholesale (fetch response, selected item, `User \| null`) | `createSignal(objectValue)` |
| Value derived from other reactive values | plain function `() => ...` (never a signal synced by an effect) |
| Expensive derivation, multiple consumers, or equality boundary needed | `createMemo(() => ...)` |
| Follows a prop but user can locally override; prop change resets | writable derivation: `createSignal(() => props.value)` / `createStore(() => props.value, fallback)` |
| Shared by a subtree, independent per provider instance | signal/store created inside a provider component, passed via context |
| App-wide state (theme, session, cart, locale) | the same provider, placed at the root of `App` — not a module-level signal/store (under SSR one module instance serves every request) |
| Constants (a category list, a formatter, the `createContext` call) | module scope |
| Tentative value during a mutation | `createOptimistic` / `createOptimisticStore` + `action` |
| Values pushed by an external subscription (websocket, reactive client) | async iterable returned from a memo (or function-form `createStore` for keyed reconciliation) — never `{ data, error }` signal pairs |

### Should this be an effect?

Most React `useEffect` code should NOT become `createEffect`:

| React habit | Solid 2 |
|---|---|
| Compute a rendered value in an effect | plain function or `createMemo` |
| Fetch data in an effect, copy into state | `createMemo(async () => ...)` + `<Loading>` |
| React to a user interaction | do the work in the event handler or an `action` |
| Sync one state into another | delete the second state; derive it |
| Reset/clear state when another reactive value changes | writable derivation: `createSignal(() => { source(); return initial; })` — not an effect calling the setter |
| Push a settled reactive value into a non-Solid system (DOM API, third-party widget, analytics, subscription) | `createEffect(compute, apply)` — this is the only real use |
| One-time setup after mount (`onMount`) | `onSettled(() => { ...; return cleanup })` |
| Measure DOM / observe size after paint | ref **directive factory** + `onSettled` (writes a *new* input; not an effect that copies state) |

### Composition, code-splitting, SSR

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Wrapper that only renders its children | `{props.children}` — no helper |
| Inspect, count, or iterate children | `children(() => props.children)` then `.toArray()` |
| Code-split a component | `lazy(() => import("./X"))` read under `<Loading>` |
| Named export from a lazy module | `lazy(() => import("./pages"), { export: "About" })` |
| Pick a component/tag from reactive state | `dynamic(() => ...)` from `@solidjs/web` (stable identity; `<Dynamic>` is deprecated) <!-- upstream:dynamic-deprecated --> |
| Overlay / modal | `<Portal>` — hoist async reads *above* the portal (reads inside start on the client) |
| Async value used several layers down | Create the memo high; pass `value={memo()}` through intermediates (they do not wait); put `<Loading>` around the leaf read |
| Nested child with its own fetch | Leave it nested — it runs in parallel. Sequential only when the second call needs the first response (`fetchAuthor(story().authorId)`) |
| Browser-only widget (charts, maps, `window`) | `clientOnly(() => import("./Chart"))` from `@solidjs/web` (`{ lazy: true }` defers the import until first render; `{ export: "Chart" }` for a named export). Placeholder: `<Chart fallback={<Skeleton />} />` — SSR renders the fallback; a `<Loading>` around it leaves the server HTML empty |
| Browser-only *value* (`localStorage`, viewport size) | `createMemo(..., { ssrSource: "client" })` — per-value policy at the data source, no component split (`"hybrid"` when server data mixes with client signals) |
| Server vs browser code path | `isServer` / `isDev` from `@solidjs/web` (build-time constants), not `typeof window` — never to choose markup (`{isServer ? <A /> : <B />}` is a hydration mismatch; use `clientOnly` / `ssrSource`) |
| SSR-stable `id` / `for` / `aria-*` pairing | `createUniqueId()` |

## Canonical patterns

### Component with local state and derived value

```tsx
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  const doubled = () => count() * 2; // derivation: a function, not a memo, not an effect

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>
      {count()} x 2 = {doubled()}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Props: read late, never destructure

```tsx
// CORRECT — reads happen inside JSX (a tracking scope)
function Greeting(props: { name: string; punctuation?: string }) {
  return <p>Hello, {props.name}{props.punctuation ?? '.'}</p>;
}

// WRONG — reads the getter once at setup; never updates again
function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) { /* ... */ }
```

To give a derived prop a local name, name the *function* (or `createMemo` if expensive):

```tsx
const full = () => `${props.first} ${props.last}`;
```

To merge defaults or split props reactively use `merge` / `omit` from `solid-js`
(replacements for Solid 1.x `mergeProps` / `splitProps`). `merge` is like
`Object.assign`: an explicit `undefined` **overrides** the previous source.
Omitted keys still fall through, so `merge({ type: "button" }, props)` is the
usual defaults pattern. That is not Solid 1 `mergeProps`, which ignored
`undefined`. Forwarding leftover props: `const rest = omit(props, "label")` then
`<input {...rest} />`; a predicate hides keys by rule without enumerating first
(`omit(props, (key) => key.startsWith("data-"))`). `const rest = { ...props }` compiles
and then never updates. Both helpers return **read-only live views** (since
2.0.0-rc.9 for every input, plain objects included): assigning onto the result is a
silent no-op, and `{ ...merged }` is an own object that carries no sources. <!-- upstream:merge-omit-readonly -->

### Store updates (draft mutation)

```tsx
import { createStore } from 'solid-js';

const [profile, setProfile] = createStore({ name: 'Ada', role: 'Engineer' });

setProfile((draft) => {
  draft.name = 'Grace'; // only readers of .name re-run
});
```

The setter callback is a **synchronous transaction** — the draft closes when it
returns. `setProfile(async (draft) => { draft.name = await load(); })` used to commit
only the writes before the first `await` and silently drop the rest; since
2.0.0-rc.9 it throws `[ASYNC_STORE_SETTER]` in dev (`solid2-kit check` flags it too). <!-- upstream:async-store-setter-throws -->
Await outside, then write synchronously (inside an `action`, `yield` first):

```tsx
// WRONG — the draft is already closed when the await resumes
setProfile(async (draft) => { draft.name = await fetchName(); });

// CORRECT
const name = await fetchName();
setProfile((draft) => { draft.name = name; });
```

A signal may hold a promise, so `setSignal` has no such rule. A store setter called
at component-body top level is a write in an owned scope — dev throws
`[REACTIVE_WRITE_IN_OWNED_SCOPE]` (rc.9 closed the exemption store writes had) <!-- upstream:store-write-owned-scope --> — so
seed the shape through the `createStore` argument or a derivation.

**The store itself is read-only; only the draft writes.** An assignment or mutating
call on the store proxy outside a setter is *ignored* — no throw, no dev warning, the
value does not change, and TypeScript accepts it (`Store<T>` is `T`). This is the
MobX / Vue / Solid 1 `createMutable` reflex:

```tsx
// WRONG — all silently ignored
todos.push(todo);
state.count++;
todo.done = !todo.done;

// CORRECT
setTodos((draft) => { draft.push(todo); });
setState((draft) => { draft.count++; });
setTodos((draft) => {
  const row = draft.find((t) => t.id === id);
  if (row) row.done = !row.done;
});
```

Plain objects and arrays are proxied; `Map`, `Set`, and `Date` are stored as they are.
`draft.selected.add(id)` inside a setter mutates the `Set` but notifies nobody. Keep a
set of ids as `Record<string, true>` (`draft.selected[id] = true` /
`delete draft.selected[id]`, both tracked) or an array, or assign a new instance
(`draft.tags = new Set([...draft.tags, tag])`) so the property itself changes.

**External collections enter stores through reconciliation, never wholesale assignment.**
`draft.todos = serverTodos` renders correctly but replaces every object identity — all
subscribers under the path re-run and row identity is lost. In order of preference:

1. Function-form `createStore(() => source, fallback)` or `createProjection` — reconcile
   automatically (keyed by `"id"`), surviving items keep proxy identity.
2. Manual merge: `setTodos(reconcile(fresh, 'id'))`, or on a nested slot
   `setState((draft) => { reconcile(fresh, 'id')(draft.todos); })`. Positional data
   (fixed-shape dashboards): `reconcile(next, null)`.

Plain non-reactive view for logging/serialization: `snapshot(store)`. It is not a copy —
subtrees with no pending changes are the store's own objects, so mutating the snapshot
(or letting a library `sort()` it) changes the store with no notification. Edit
`structuredClone(snapshot(store))` instead.
Subscribe an effect compute to every nested change: `deep(store)`.

### Children: pass through, or resolve with `children()`

Most wrappers just render `props.children`. Use the `children` helper only when
the component must **inspect or iterate** them. It returns an accessor with
`.toArray()`. The helper call belongs in the component body; the read of
`props.children` is inside the accessor (a tracking scope), so this is not a
setup-time snapshot. Do not assign `const kids = props.children` and do not
treat resolved children as a reactive data list for `<For>` —
render `{resolved.toArray()}`, not `<For each={resolved()}>`:

```tsx
import { children, type ParentProps } from 'solid-js';

function Stack(props: ParentProps) {
  const resolved = children(() => props.children);
  return <div class="stack">{resolved.toArray()}</div>;
}
```

### Code-splitting: `lazy` + `<Loading>`

```tsx
import { lazy, Loading } from 'solid-js';

const Profile = lazy(() => import('./Profile'));
const About = lazy(() => import('./pages'), { export: 'About' });

<Loading fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <Profile id="42" />
</Loading>

<button type="button" onMouseEnter={() => Profile.preload()}>Open profile</button>
```

Never `React.lazy` / `<Suspense>`. The lazy component suspends through
`<Loading>` on first render; `.preload()` starts the import early. Named
exports must use `{ export: "About" }` — a `.then((m) => ({ default: m.About }))`
wrapper hydrates incorrectly (the name is not a call-site literal).

### Dynamic component: `dynamic()` (canonical)

```tsx
import { createSignal, type Component } from 'solid-js';
import { dynamic } from '@solidjs/web';

const Compact: Component<{ value: string }> = (props) => <span>{props.value}</span>;
const Detailed: Component<{ value: string }> = (props) => <strong>{props.value}</strong>;

const [detailed, setDetailed] = createSignal(false);
const Result = dynamic(() => (detailed() ? Detailed : Compact));

<Result value="Current result" />
```

`dynamic()` returns a **stable** component whose source can be a component, an
intrinsic tag name, a promise, or empty. Prefer it over swapping a component
variable in JSX (`const View = tab() ? A : B` freezes the choice at setup).
`<Dynamic component={...}>` is the same primitive with a worse shape (the tag travels
in the props bag, so every instance merges and omits it and rebuilds a factory) and
is **deprecated** since 2.0.0-rc.9 — `@deprecated` in the types, no runtime warning,
still shipped in 2.0. <!-- upstream:dynamic-deprecated --> Hoist a `dynamic()` per component instance (or per module for a
constant tag) instead.

### Two-phase effect (imperative boundary only)

```tsx
import { createEffect } from 'solid-js';

createEffect(
  () => props.roomId,          // compute: ALL reactive reads here; return value feeds apply
  (roomId) => {                // apply: untracked imperative work
    const connection = chat.connect(roomId);
    return () => connection.close(); // cleanup before next run / on disposal
  },
);
```

`apply` returns a cleanup function or nothing — write it with a **block body**. An
expression-bodied arrow returns whatever the expression evaluates to: an assignment
(`(t) => (document.title = t)`) returns the string, and a setter (`(v) => setDraft(v)`)
returns the value it set. Dev throws `effect callback returned an invalid cleanup value`,
production throws a `TypeError` on the next run, and both halt the whole
reactive system (`[REACTIVITY_HALTED]`). TypeScript reports it as TS2345; a JS project
gets no warning. The cleanup of an effect is the `apply` return value — `onCleanup`
inside `apply` has no owner and never runs (`[NO_OWNER_CLEANUP]`).

```tsx
// WRONG — returns the assigned string; halts reactivity (dev: first run, prod: next run)
createEffect(() => title(), (t) => (document.title = t));

// CORRECT
createEffect(() => title(), (t) => {
  document.title = t;
});
```

Reads inside `apply` do not track. Extract every needed reactive value in `compute`
(e.g. `() => ({ name: user.name, role: user.role })`). Passing a store proxy into `apply`
and reading `user.name` there *runs once* and never retriggers. Compute-phase errors can be
intercepted with the bundle form `createEffect(compute, { effect, error })`. Skip the
initial run with `{ defer: true }` — the `on(deps, fn, { defer: true })` replacement;
the effect first runs on the next change.

A two-phase effect whose apply only calls a local signal setter is "state + effect" in
disguise — formally legal Solid 2, still rule 4 (`solid2-kit check` flags it). The reset
form of a writable derivation replaces it, and moves the source read to the read site
(under that site's boundaries) instead of an effect compute:

```tsx
// WRONG — signal synced by an effect; organizer() errors bypass the read site's <Errored>
const [signInError, setSignInError] = createSignal<string | null>(null);
createEffect(
  () => organizer(),
  (id) => {
    if (id !== null) setSignInError(null);
  },
);

// CORRECT — writable derivation: resets when organizer() changes; the setter still works
const [signInError, setSignInError] = createSignal<string | null>(() => {
  organizer();
  return null;
});
```

The writable form spells exactly this: derive from the source, allow a local
override, reset when the source changes. (React needs `useState(props.x)` plus a
`previousX` comparison reset during render for the same behavior.)

### Async data — fetch high, block low

Creating and reading an async value are the same as sync. **Consuming** (the
await) is a DX choice; **blocking** (the boundary) is a UX choice. Solid
unwelds them: where you create the memo is performance, where `<Loading>`
wraps the *read* is design, and neither is an architecture decision. JSX
component props are lazy (**passing isn't reading**), so intermediates do
not wait. Nested components mount immediately — they do not suspend — so
their fetches run in parallel. Making a value remote should touch the memo
and the boundary, not every file on the path, and should not change prop
types to `Promise<User>` or `Accessor<User>`.

```tsx
import { Errored, Loading, createMemo, createSignal, isPending } from 'solid-js';

function App() {
  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = createSignal(1);
  const story = createMemo(() => fetchStory(selectedId()));

  return (
    <Errored fallback={(error, reset) => <ErrorFallback error={error} reset={reset} />}>
      <StoryList selectedId={selectedId()} onSelect={setSelectedId} />
      <main class={{ pending: isPending(selectedId) }}>
        <Loading fallback={<DetailSkeleton />}>
          <StoryDetail story={story()} storyId={selectedId()} />
        </Loading>
      </main>
    </Errored>
  );
}

function StoryDetail(props: { story: Story; storyId: number }) {
  const byline = createMemo(() => `${props.story.author} · ${props.story.points} points`);
  return (
    <article class={{ stale: isPending(() => props.story) }}>
      <h1>{props.story.title}</h1>
      <p>{byline()}</p>
      <Comments storyId={props.storyId} />
    </article>
  );
}
```

`story()` is a `Story`, not `Story | undefined` — if the computation is running,
the value is there. No `?.`, no `!`. `<StoryDetail story={story()} />` is the
correct colorless form: the prop expression is a getter, so `StoryDetail` (and
every layout in between) renders immediately. The wait happens when
`props.story.title` is read, under that `<Loading>`.

```tsx
// WRONG — extracting at the parent is a real read; child's <Loading> never sees it
const current = story();
return <StoryDetail story={current} />;

// WRONG — Promise / Accessor types on the path. Making story remote is not a
// type change for StoryLayout / StoryDetail.
function StoryDetail(props: { story: Promise<Story> }) { /* ... */ }
function StoryDetail(props: { story: Accessor<Story> }) { /* ... */ }

// Fine — pass the memo itself only when the child must refresh() that source.
// isPending / latest are questions: they work on the value prop too.
return <StoryDetail story={story} />;
```

- The `<Loading>` boundary must be an owner ancestor of the **read**, not of
  where the memo was created, and not of page chrome (header/nav) that should stay mounted.
  Lifting the fetch does **not** mean lifting the boundary — that is consume glued
  back onto block. After first paint the
  boundary keeps settled content during refetch; `isPending(results)` (pass the accessor,
  not `isPending(results())`) is the indicator. Use `on={query()}` (the **value**, not the
  accessor `on={query}`) only when that identity should put the fallback back on screen.
  Do not use `isPending` as the first-load spinner.
- **Nesting is not a waterfall.** `Comments` above fetches in parallel with `story`
  because it reads `props.storyId` (already known), not `props.story`. Passing
  `storyId={props.story.id}` *would* wait on the story fetch — that is a real data
  dependency, same as `createMemo(() => fetchAuthor(story().authorId))`. Components
  do not suspend; they run once. Only the expressions that read wait, so a parent
  JSX read does not delay a child that does not need that value.
- `isPending` is a **per-expression question**, not state and not a global spinner.
  Ask it anywhere: on the async source (`isPending(results)`), below it
  (`isPending(() => props.story)`), on a derived memo (`isPending(byline)`), or
  *above* the fetch but below the write (`isPending(selectedId)`), even when the
  fetch lives in a child. You do not need to pass the memo accessor just to ask.
  Granularity is the expression: `isPending(() => item.quantity)` (paired with
  `affects(item, "quantity")`) or `isPending(() => todos.length)` dims only what
  that read depends on. A hold with no feedback at all is `[SILENT_HOLD]` under
  attribution — always pair a held write with one of these questions, an
  optimistic value, or `affects()`.
- Default navigation **holds**. `selectedId()` and the old story stay put until
  the new answer lands, so the highlight never points at the wrong content.
  `latest(selectedId)` is the opt-in when the design wants the highlight to move
  on click. Pair `class={{ pending: isPending(selectedId) }}` with a short CSS
  `transition-delay` so fast swaps do not flash. Inputs that feed a request follow
  the same rule: bind `value={latest(query)}` so a controlled search box reflects
  keystrokes while its write is held (an uncontrolled input needs nothing).
- Read every reactive input **before the first `await`** in an async computation. A read
  after `await` does not subscribe; production can sit pending with no retry.
- `<Errored>` function fallbacks receive an error **accessor** and a `reset` callback:
  `fallback={(error, reset) => ...}`. The boundary **heals** when the source succeeds
  again (refresh, live reconnect, input change) — it is graph status, not a terminal
  React ErrorBoundary. `reset` retries the collected *data sources*, not a UI remount.
- Refetch: `refresh(results)`. In-flight indicator: `isPending(results)` (or
  `isPending(() => results())`). Freshest in-flight value for a preview:
  `latest(results)`. `latest` is not a null-safe probe: before the source's first value
  it throws `NotReadyError` in every scope (since 2.0.0-rc.9 also in event handlers and
  imperative code, which used to receive `undefined`) <!-- upstream:latest-throws-unsettled -->. A write is visible to `latest()` /
  `isPending()` only from the flush that carries it — `flush()` first when a test reads
  its own write through them. Do not start `fetch` at component-body top level.
- Coordinate sibling `<Loading>` reveal with `<Reveal>` (`order="sequential"` default,
  or `"together"` / `"natural"`). `collapsed` (sequential only) suppresses tail
  skeletons past the frontier so the page does not stack fallbacks as popcorn.

**Never hand-roll these states.** No `[loading, setLoading]` signal, no
`data() === undefined` branch, no `{ data, error }` signal pair — those are React/Solid 1.x
reflexes that bypass the async model and `solid2-kit check` flags them. If a value is async,
make it an async computation and read it under boundaries. Refetching is `refresh(source)`
(typically as the last step of a mutation `action`, or a reload button) — never a
counter/version signal read inside the computation to force re-runs; input-driven refetch is
already automatic. No request counters or `AbortController`s for dedup/cancellation
either — superseded answers are dropped automatically and settled content holds;
debounce at the event handler (`onInput={debounce(...)}`), never as an effect copying
one signal into another. And throw unusable responses instead of returning
`{ success: false }` objects checked at every read — failures travel to `<Errored>`
like values.

**Normalize thrown values once.** Thrown values are `unknown` in JavaScript, so define one
shared `ErrorFallback` component per app — extract the message via `instanceof Error`, wire
`reset` to a Retry affordance — and pass it to every `<Errored fallback>`, instead of
repeating `String(error())` at each boundary:

```tsx
<Errored fallback={(error, reset) => <ErrorFallback error={error} reset={reset} />}>
```

**Report boundary-caught errors through the error hooks, not from the fallback.** An
error an `<Errored>` collected never reaches `window.onerror`; a `captureException`
call inside `fallback` is a side effect in render that fires on every re-render of the
fallback. Since 2.0.0-rc.9 the runtime has a seam for exactly this failure, called
once per error object with where it was thrown (`ownerPath`) and where it was met
(`boundaryPath`):

```ts
import { configureClientErrors } from 'solid-js';
import { configureServerErrors } from '@solidjs/web';

configureClientErrors({
  onError: (error, { ownerPath, boundaryPath }) => report(error, { ownerPath, boundaryPath }),
});
// server side (SSR renders and server functions); runs inside the request scope, so
// getRequestEvent() works here. Return nothing, or a reference the user can quote —
// NEVER the error itself: the return value replaces the sanitized value on the wire
configureServerErrors({
  onError(error, { kind, handling, ownerPath, boundaryPath, functionId, direct }) {
    const ref = report(error, { site: `${kind}/${handling}`, ownerPath, boundaryPath, functionId, direct });
    return new Error(`Something went wrong (ref ${ref})`);
  },
});
```

**The server hook's return value goes on the wire.** What the client normally receives
is the runtime's sanitized value (a generic `Error` outside the dev build). Returning
the error object hands its `message`, stack, and whatever secret they carry to the
browser. `kind`/`handling` name the road: `render` / `fallback` (an `<Errored>`
rendered), `render` / `client` (a `<Loading>` fragment rejected, client re-renders),
`render` / `failed` (request fails; return ignored), `render` / `serialize` (a
hydration value would not serialize), `server-function` / `thrown` (`direct: true` for
an in-process call during SSR), `server-function` / `channel` (a rejection or throw
escaping through the result graph — a promise, an iterable, or a stream — after the
head committed). A monitoring SDK's `init()` that
registers this hook must load before the server graph — put it in the plugin's
`start: { instrument: "./src/instrument.ts" }`, not at the top of an entry (see
[Production observability](#production-observability-the-observe-build)).

`render` / `hydrate` accept a per-root `onError` that wins over the ambient hook —
`render(() => <App />, root, undefined, { onError })` (options are the 4th argument; a
3rd-argument object is taken as `init` and the hook is silently not installed) and
`hydrate(() => <App />, root, { onError })`.
Uncaught errors (`REACTIVITY_HALTED`) go to the platform's `reportError`, which every
monitor already listens on — do not report them twice. `renderToStream` /
`renderToString`'s `onError` option *is* the per-render server hook: it now hears every
handled failure, so filter on `context.handling === "failed"` when only request-failing
errors matter (the rc.8 one-argument form keeps working). <!-- upstream:render-onerror-handled -->

### Streams and subscriptions (websockets, reactive clients)

Push-based sources integrate by returning an **async iterable** from a computation — reads
then suspend to `<Loading>` until the first value, later pushes update the settled value,
and thrown errors reach `<Errored>`. Integration layers should return a plain accessor, not
`{ data, error }` signals:

```tsx
import { createMemo, onCleanup } from 'solid-js';

function createSubscriptionQuery<T>(
  subscribe: (next: (value: T) => void, fail: (error: unknown) => void) => () => void,
) {
  const queue: T[] = [];
  let failure: unknown;
  let wake = () => {};
  // Custom primitive: unsubscribe is tied to the caller's owner via onCleanup.
  // Component bodies use onSettled and return cleanup instead.
  onCleanup(subscribe(
    (value) => { queue.push(value); wake(); },
    (error) => { failure = error; wake(); },
  ));

  return createMemo(() => (async function* () {
    while (true) {
      if (failure !== undefined) throw failure;
      if (queue.length > 0) { yield queue.shift() as T; continue; }
      await new Promise<void>((resolve) => { wake = resolve; });
    }
  })());
}
```

Server-function `live()` sources are the same shape (async iterable → memo). Connection
state is `source.onstatus` (`"connected"` / `"reconnecting"` / `"closed"`), not a field
in the yielded value — see [Server functions](#server-functions--use-server).

### Mutations: `action` + optimistic state

The synchronous mutation *is* the prediction. Optimistic UI is not a second copy of
state — it is an overlay the graph discards when the action settles (pass or fail).
There is no rollback to write. Put in-flight affordances on the record
(`pending?: boolean`); they vanish with the overlay.

Minimal shape — the durable value derives from `fn`, optimistic writes overlay it,
and `refresh` re-runs the derivation so the store reconciles against the server
(no separate `getMessages()` call):

```tsx
import { action, createOptimisticStore, refresh } from 'solid-js';

function createMessages() { // call from a component — not module scope (SSR shares modules)
  const [messages, setMessages] = createOptimisticStore(() => getMessages(), []);

  const addMessage = action(function* (message: Message) {
    setMessages((m) => { m.push(message); });
    yield saveMessage(message);
    refresh(messages);
  });
  return [messages, { addMessage }] as const;
}
```

Mutate the draft (`m.push(message)`), never spread-rebuild (`[...m, message]`) —
stores track writes finely, so only the changed part updates. When the action
settles, the overlay is discarded and the refreshed server data is authoritative;
if it agrees with the prediction, reconciliation finds no differences and nothing
re-renders. Derived reconciliation keys by `"id"` by default — pass `{ key: ... }`
only when the identity field differs.

Layered form, when per-row UI must survive overlay discard (a recoverable error
with Retry on that row only):

```tsx
import { action, createOptimisticStore, refresh } from 'solid-js';

type Todo = { id: string; title: string; completed: boolean; pending?: boolean; error?: { completed: boolean } };

function createTodos() { // call from a component — not module scope (SSR shares modules)
  const errors = new Map<string, { completed: boolean }>();
  const [todos, setTodos] = createOptimisticStore<Todo[]>(async () => {
    const current = await api.list();
    return current.map((todo) => {
      const error = errors.get(todo.id);
      return error ? { ...todo, error } : todo;
    });
  }, []);

  const toggleTodo = action(function* (id: string, completed: boolean) {
    setTodos((draft) => {
      const todo = draft.find((row) => row.id === id);
      if (!todo) return;
      todo.completed = completed;
      todo.pending = true;
    });
    try {
      yield api.toggle(id, completed);
      errors.delete(id);
    } catch {
      errors.set(id, { completed });
    } finally {
      refresh(todos);
    }
  });
  return [todos, { toggleTodo }] as const;
}
```

Three layers, in this order: durable source → ephemeral UI that must survive
overlay discard (the `errors` map, folded in the projection) → optimistic overlay
(`pending`, the predicted `completed`). Consumers read one store. Catch
*expected* mutation failures in the action, because nothing else will show them:
an error that escapes an action discards its optimistic writes and rejects the
promise the call returned — it never reaches `<Errored>`, which catches failing
reads and renders only (projection and render errors still reach the boundary).
Uncaught, the UI silently reverts and the rejection is unhandled. Put expected
failures in the errors map or a toast inside the action, and `.catch` the call in
the handler for the rest:

```tsx
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    removeTodo(todo.id).catch(() => showToast('Could not delete'));
  }}
>
  Delete
</button>
```

Going from a client store to the server is **additive**: same `setTodos`
calls, wrap each mutation in `action`, swap in the **function form**
`createOptimisticStore(() => api.list(), [])` (with `refresh` after the `yield`) and a
file of server functions. Do not rewrite `App.tsx` with loading/error branches,
and do not snapshot-the-cache / write-a-prediction / restore-on-error. A cache
library is not the productionizing step — the sync mutation already was the
prediction. (Router `query` or `@tanstack/solid-query` remain valid when the
project already uses them; they are not required to "make it real". Solid 2's
TanStack Query is `@tanstack/solid-query@rc` (6.x) — npm `latest` is the Solid 1 5.x line.)
Optimistic rows stay interactive — a not-yet-acked todo can still
be toggled. Do not disable the control until confirmation, and do not mutex
rapid clicks; `action` is the transaction (no half-mutation, no interleaved
list). An in-flight action does not freeze unrelated writes. Collecting failed
actions to replay is a design choice, not something the runtime requires.

Ordinary signal/store writes inside an action are held until it settles. Never call
`flush()` inside an action. Invoke actions from handlers, not from component/computation bodies.
Do not set a `submitted` signal and watch it from an effect — that work belongs in the
handler or the `action`.

**The value form has no durable layer.** `createOptimisticStore([])` (or
`createOptimistic(value)`) is a pure overlay: writes inside an action vanish when it
settles, and writes outside an action do not stick. Copying the reference example
`createOptimisticStore<Todo[]>([])` and writing the saved row after the `yield`
leaves an empty list once the action settles, with no warning. <!-- upstream:optimistic-value-overlay --> Durable data comes
from the function form — `createOptimisticStore(() => api.list(), [])` refreshed
after the `yield`, or `createOptimisticStore(() => base.todos, [])` over a separate
`createStore` that the action writes the confirmed value into. Keep the value form for
in-flight flags.

`createOptimistic` / `createOptimisticStore` are for a tentative value during an
active mutation, not a local editing session (use a writable derivation or a plain
store for that). A whole-form `createOptimistic(false)` saving flag is fine; prefer
`pending` on the record when the affordance is per item. The overlay is
discarded when the action settles — the confirmed store is the truth. Wrapping
the same store in server functions does not change that; do not add
snapshot/restore.

**`yield`, not a bare `await`, is the transaction boundary.** `await api.save()` then
`setTodos(...)` *runs*, but the write commits immediately — it is not held as an
overlay. Either `yield saveTodo(todo)` or, when you need a typed result, `const saved = await api.save(); yield; setTodos(...)`.
Write the body as a generator — `function*` or `async function*`, never a plain
`async (...) =>` — because only `yield` re-enters the transaction: the runtime has no
hook into a plain `await` continuation, so even inside `async function*` an `await`
leaves the transaction until the next `yield` (`solid2-kit check` flags the
non-generator form). The bare `yield` must also come before anything that **creates a
reader** — `until()`, `latest()`, a memo or effect, a mount — not only before writes:
the expression of the next `yield` is evaluated in the post-`await` continuation, so
`await save(); yield until(...)` builds the predicate's reader outside the transaction.
Write `await save(); yield; yield until(...)`.

When confirmation arrives outside the response — a fire-and-forget transport echoed
back on a live source — hold the action open with `yield until(predicate, { timeout })`:

```tsx
const send = action(function* (text: string) {
  const clientId = crypto.randomUUID();
  setMessages((m) => { m.push({ clientId, text, pending: true }); });
  yield socket.send({ clientId, text });
  yield until(() => messages.some((m) => m.clientId === clientId), { timeout: 10_000 });
});
```

The predicate reads authoritative state, so the optimistic row cannot satisfy it;
only the echo can. Timeout rejects with `TimeoutError` (strongly recommended on
droppable transports; abort via `signal`). Outside actions, `await until(() => user())`
waits for a value before continuing.

The same hold applies when the mutation *does* answer but the value is read through a
`live()` source. A live source updates only through its open stream — it takes no part
in revalidation or single-flight mutation data — so the mutation's response and the
stream's echo race. Settle on `yield saveBid(...)` alone and the overlay is discarded
first: the old bid flashes back until the stream catches up.

```tsx
import { action, createOptimisticStore, until } from 'solid-js';
import { liveAuction, saveBid } from '../data/auction';

function Auction(props: { id: string }) {
  const [auction, setAuction] = createOptimisticStore(() => liveAuction(props.id), { highBid: 0 });

  const bid = action(function* (amount: number) {
    setAuction((a) => { a.highBid = amount; });                    // overlay
    yield saveBid(props.id, amount);                                 // the write goes up
    yield until(() => auction.highBid >= amount, { timeout: 10_000 }); // hold for the echo
  });

  return <button onClick={() => bid(auction.highBid + 1)}>Bid {auction.highBid + 1}</button>;
}
```

Do not `refresh(auction)` in place of `until`: on a store derived from a live source it
re-runs the derivation — the current stream is closed and `liveAuction()` opens a new
connection. That costs a reconnect per mutation and hides the flash only when the new
connection's first value already includes the write; when the read side lags the write,
the old value still flashes back before the echo. Reactive clients whose
subscriptions already carry the write when the mutation resolves (e.g. Convex) need
neither. The server side of `liveAuction` / `saveBid` is in
[Server functions](#server-functions--use-server).

Navigation-shaped updates do **not** need core `action`. A plain setter is enough:
reads pull the async, and downstream async computeds hold previous values until the
new ones are ready (`isPending` / `latest`). Reach for `action` from `solid-js` only
when writes happen *after* async work. Router form `action` from `@solidjs/router` is
a different API (URL + POST) — see [App stack](#app-stack-only-if-the-project-has-these-packages).

### Lists: `<For>` child signatures per keying mode

```tsx
// Default (keyed by item reference): item is the RAW value, index is an accessor
<For each={todos()}>{(todo, index) => <Row todo={todo} n={index()} />}</For>

// Key function: BOTH are accessors
<For each={todos()} keyed={(todo) => todo.id}>{(todo) => <Row todo={todo()} />}</For>

// Positional (Solid 1.x <Index>): item is an accessor, index is a plain number
<For each={cells()} keyed={false}>{(cell, i) => <Cell value={cell()} at={i} />}</For>
```

Choosing the keying mode:

| Where the rows come from | Mode |
|---|---|
| Server/refetched data — fetch results, subscription payloads (fresh object references on every update) | **key function on a stable id** (`keyed={(item) => item.id}`) — reference keying would recreate every row on each update |
| Local array whose item identities are stable (e.g. store rows, static lists) | default (item reference) |
| Fixed positions where only contents change | `keyed={false}` |

Never `{todos().map((t) => <Row todo={t} />)}` and never `<For each={todos().map(...)}>`.
The `.map` form *renders*; it just rebuilds every row. `children().toArray().map` is
fine — those nodes are already resolved.

`<Repeat from={start()} count={20}>{(index) => ...}</Repeat>` renders by absolute index with
no array diffing — use for fixed slot counts and virtual scrolling windows.

### Conditionals

Ternaries work and are reactive, but **when the truthy branch reads the tested value, use
`<Show>`**: its function child receives a narrowed accessor, so no non-null assertion is
needed. Never write `value()!` to narrow by hand (`solid2-kit check` flags it):

```tsx
// WRONG — hand narrowing with a non-null assertion
{error() ? <p>{error()!.message}</p> : <TaskList />}

// CORRECT — Show narrows; fallback holds the other branch
<Show when={error()} fallback={<TaskList />}>
  {(err) => <p>{err().message}</p>}
</Show>
```

```tsx
<Show when={user()} fallback={<SignIn />}>
  {(currentUser) => <Profile user={currentUser()} />} {/* narrowed ACCESSOR */}
</Show>
```

Plain ternaries remain fine when no narrowing is involved (`{open() ? <A /> : <B />}`).

Default `Show` keeps children mounted across truthy changes. Add `keyed` to remount when the
value's identity changes (child then receives the raw value, like React's `key` reset).
Prefer the default; use `keyed` only when internal state must reset. Multi-branch:
`<Switch>` / `<Match>` — **first truthy `<Match>` wins**; later matches are skipped,
even if they are also truthy.

Components must **return once**: never early-return based on a reactive value — the branch
is picked at setup and frozen. Early returns on non-reactive values (build-time config, a
missing environment variable) are fine.

### Input filtering (inputs do not rewind)

React's controlled inputs force the DOM back to the state value on every re-render, so
"ignore invalid keystrokes" works by simply not updating state. Solid has no re-render:
`value={v()}` writes the DOM only when `v` changes, so rejected characters **stay visible**
unless you rewind the DOM yourself:

```tsx
<input
  value={v()}
  onInput={(event) => {
    if (/^\d*$/.test(event.currentTarget.value)) setV(event.currentTarget.value);
    else event.currentTarget.value = v(); // reject: explicit write-back
  }}
/>
```

### Context

```tsx
import { createContext, createSignal, useContext } from 'solid-js';
import type { Accessor, ParentProps, Setter } from 'solid-js';

type Theme = 'light' | 'dark';

const ThemeContext = createContext<{ theme: Accessor<Theme>; setTheme: Setter<Theme> }>();

function ThemeProvider(props: ParentProps) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = createSignal<Theme>('light');
  return <ThemeContext value={{ theme, setTheme }}>{props.children}</ThemeContext>;
}

function ThemeButton() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext); // destructuring here is FINE
  return <button onClick={() => setTheme('dark')}>{theme()}</button>;
}
```

Pass accessors/setters/stores through context — never `value={theme()}` (a dead snapshot).
No `useMemo` for the value object, no context splitting: the object is created once and
fine-grained updates flow through the signals inside it.

**App-wide state is the same provider, placed at the root of `App`** — not a
module-level signal or store. Module scope is for constants and the `createContext`
call itself:

```tsx
import { createContext, createStore, useContext, type ParentProps } from 'solid-js';

type CartItem = { id: string; quantity: number };

// WRONG under SSR — one store for every request the server ever handles
// export const [cart, setCart] = createStore({ items: [] as CartItem[] });

// CORRECT — one store per provider instance: per tab in the browser, per request on the server
function createCart() {
  const [cart, setCart] = createStore({ items: [] as CartItem[] });
  return { cart, setCart };
}

const CartContext = createContext<ReturnType<typeof createCart>>();

export function CartProvider(props: ParentProps) {
  return <CartContext value={createCart()}>{props.children}</CartContext>;
}

export function useCart() {
  return useContext(CartContext); // throws ContextNotFoundError outside CartProvider
}

// App: <CartProvider><ThemeProvider>{/* router / pages */}</ThemeProvider></CartProvider>
```

Module state has no owner (nothing disposes it), and under `ssr: true` the server
loads the module once and serves every request from it: `createStore(value)` on the
server is the plain object, so one visitor's writes render into the next visitor's
HTML (`[SERVER_WRITE]`). A module-level store derived from a server function fails
sooner — `Cannot call server function outside of a request` while the module loads.
In a client-only build a module-level store is one per tab and works, which is why it
looks fine until `ssr: true` is turned on; the provider costs nothing extra and
survives that change.

### Refs

```tsx
import { onSettled, type Ref } from 'solid-js';

function listen(type: string, handler: EventListener, options?: AddEventListenerOptions) {
  let element: HTMLElement | undefined;
  onSettled(() => {
    const target = element;
    if (!target) return;
    target.addEventListener(type, handler, options);
    return () => target.removeEventListener(type, handler, options);
  });
  return (next: HTMLElement) => { element = next; };
}

function SearchField(props: { ref?: Ref<HTMLInputElement>; onInput: EventListener }) {
  let input!: HTMLInputElement;
  return (
    <>
      <input
        ref={[props.ref, (el) => (input = el), listen('input', props.onInput, { passive: true })]}
        type="search"
      />
      <button type="button" onClick={() => input.select()}>Select</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Ref arrays flatten recursively; each callback runs in order. No `forwardRef` needed.

**Ref callbacks run untracked and without an owner.** Their return values are
ignored — do not create effects, memos, or `onCleanup` inside the callback, and
do not `return () => cleanup`. Put owned setup in a **directive factory** (like
`listen` above) and return only the element callback. Use this for
`ResizeObserver`, third-party widgets, and native listener options (`capture` /
`passive`) — Solid event props do not take those options.

### `onSettled` — one-time setup, restricted scope

`onSettled` is the `onMount` replacement, and its callback is a **restricted scope**:
`onCleanup` throws there (`[CLEANUP_IN_FORBIDDEN_SCOPE]`), creating a memo or effect
throws (`[PRIMITIVE_IN_FORBIDDEN_SCOPE]`), and so does `flush()` — each halts the
reactive system in dev. Return the cleanup; create effects and memos in the component
body, next to the `onSettled` call, not inside it.

```tsx
// WRONG — the mechanical 1.x port of onMount + onCleanup
onSettled(() => {
  const id = setInterval(tick, 1000);
  onCleanup(() => clearInterval(id));
});

// CORRECT
onSettled(() => {
  const id = setInterval(tick, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(id);
});
```

Effect callbacks follow the same shape: return the cleanup from `apply` (an
`onCleanup` there never runs), and `flush()` inside one is a no-op
(`[FLUSH_IN_EFFECT_CALLBACK]`).

### Per-value SSR policy: `ssrSource`

`clientOnly` splits a *component*; `ssrSource` keeps one *value* off the server,
decided at the data source. `createMemo`, function-form `createSignal`, and derived
stores (`createStore(fn, seed)`, `createProjection`, `createOptimisticStore(fn, seed)`)
all accept `ssrSource: "server" | "hybrid" | "client"`:

```tsx
import { Loading, createMemo } from 'solid-js';

function DraftPreview(props: { documentId: string }) {
  const draft = createMemo(
    () => localStorage.getItem(`draft:${props.documentId}`),
    { ssrSource: 'client' },
  );

  return (
    <section>
      <h2>Saved draft</h2>
      <Loading fallback={<p>Checking for a saved draft...</p>}>
        <p>{draft() ?? 'No saved draft.'}</p>
      </Loading>
    </section>
  );
}
```

| Policy | Meaning | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `"server"` (default) | Client adopts the serialized server value; compute does not re-run | Compute is deterministic from server-available inputs |
| `"hybrid"` | Client adopts the serialized value, then re-runs the compute to take over | Server data mixes with client signals (window size, user locale) |
| `"client"` | Server value skipped; compute runs after hydration as if first-mounted | Serialization is meaningless (`localStorage`, viewport) |

With `"client"`, the bare form suspends on the server and the nearest `<Loading>`
fallback renders into the HTML; a declared first value (`loadingValue` on
signal-family sources, `seedLoadingValue: true` on store-family sources) renders
provisional data with no boundary involvement instead. Filling the value in from
an `onSettled` callback remains a valid alternative; `NoHydration` / `Hydration`
split hydration *ownership* instead and do not express this policy.

## Scheduling and tests

Signal/store writes outside a synchronous flush scope are **staged**; the reactive queue
commits on the next microtask. Event handlers need nothing. Tests must flush:

```ts
setCount(2);
flush();
expect(count()).toBe(2);
```

Wait for an async expression to settle in tests: `await resolve(() => value())`.
`flush()` only drains staged **synchronous** writes — it is not a stand-in for waiting
on a pending resource. `onSettled` is also a **single** fire (untracked): it is not
`onMount` that re-runs, and it is not an effect. Run tests in dev mode first — Solid 2 emits diagnostics for top-level reactive reads,
writes from owned scopes, and async reads outside `<Loading>`. Fix them; don't suppress.
A read at component-body top level reports `[STRICT_READ_UNTRACKED]` naming the
component — move the read into JSX, a memo, or an effect compute.

Component tests use `@solidjs/testing-library@next` (1.x; npm `latest` is the Solid 1
0.8 line). Pass a **function** to `render` so
the tree has an owner, and `flush()` after interactions that stage writes:

```tsx
import { cleanup, fireEvent, render } from '@solidjs/testing-library';
import { flush } from 'solid-js';
import { afterEach, expect, test } from 'vitest';

afterEach(cleanup);

test('increments on click', () => {
  const { getByRole } = render(() => <Counter />);
  const button = getByRole('button');
  fireEvent.click(button);
  flush();
  expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Clicks: 1');
});
```

Primitive tests write **outside** the root callback — a write inside `createRoot((dispose)
=> { …; setA(2); })` is `[REACTIVE_WRITE_IN_OWNED_SCOPE]` in dev. Return the handles, then
write and `flush()`: `const { setA, b, dispose } = createRoot((dispose) => { …; return
{ setA, b, dispose }; }); setA(2); flush();`. A hook that reads context runs under
`renderHook(useCart, { wrapper: CartProvider })`. A routed component gets a router built in
the test — `createRouter({ routes, history: memoryHistory("/orders/42") })` — because
Testing Library's `render(…, { location })` is typed but not implemented (1.0.0-beta.3). <!-- upstream:testing-library-location -->

`jsxImportSource` for tests and app code is `"@solidjs/web"`, not `"solid-js"`.
Vite plugin is `@solidjs/vite-plugin`, not `vite-plugin-solid`.

To turn those dev diagnostics into a hard gate, patch `console.warn` in the test setup
file to rethrow unexpected warnings — then any top-level reactive read or unowned write
an agent sneaks in fails the suite instead of scrolling by.

### Dev diagnostics and attribution

Solid ships **three builds** of every runtime package, selected by export condition:

| Build | Condition | Carries | `OBSERVE` | `DEV` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| prod | default | the runtime + the two error hooks | `undefined` | `undefined` |
| observe | `observe` | prod + records channel, diagnostics channel, attribution slot, server trace slot; no console output, no checks | object | `undefined` |
| dev | `development` | observe + the development checks and the console reporter; unminified | object | object |

`vite dev` is **always the dev build** (the `development` condition wins), so everything
below works there with no configuration. The observe build is a *production* opt-in —
see [Production observability](#production-observability-the-observe-build) — not a
dev setting. Diagnostics come in two layers: **findings** (facts about a render, present
in observe and dev) and **checks** (dev-only guidance printed by the console reporter).
Always-on dev checks include misplaced reads
(`[STRICT_READ_UNTRACKED]`, `[PENDING_ASYNC_UNTRACKED_READ]`), misplaced writes
(`[REACTIVE_WRITE_IN_OWNED_SCOPE]` — since rc.9 also for store setters called in a
component or root body <!-- upstream:store-write-owned-scope -->, `[ASYNC_STORE_SETTER]` for a store setter callback that returns
a promise <!-- upstream:async-store-setter-throws -->, `[FLUSH_IN_ACTION]`, `[SERVER_WRITE]`), and
`[ASYNC_OUTSIDE_LOADING_BOUNDARY]` when a tracked read has no boundary above it.
Each entry carries a stable `[CODE]`, what the runtime observed, and an owner chain
(`in <App> › <Cart> › <LineItem>`); never silence a code before understanding it.
Since rc.9 the server render reports on the same channel with the same owner chains:
`[SSR_RENDER_ERROR_CONTAINED]` (a boundary routed a render error; `ownerPath` is where
it was thrown, `boundaryPath` where it was met) <!-- upstream:ssr-render-error-contained -->, `[SSR_ERROR_SANITIZED]` (the original
behind a production-sanitized error), `[SSR_CLIENT_CONTENT_MASKED]` (client-only content
that surfaced only after a real server wait — the wait was wasted), server-side
`[ASYNC_WATERFALL]`, and `[REVEAL_IN_RENDER_TO_STRING]`.
For the repair behind any code, read the `reactivity-diagnostics` skill Solid ships
in the repo (`node_modules/solid-js/skills/reactivity-diagnostics/SKILL.md`) — every
code maps to what the runtime observed and what to change.

Cost and responsiveness findings need the opt-in attribution engine, which records
every scope that re-ran, what changed to cause it, and how long it took. Since
`solid-js` 2.0.0-rc.8 the engine lives behind its own subpath — `DEV.attribution`
no longer exists <!-- upstream:dev-attribution-removed --> (it is a type error; `DEV` holds only devtools hooks, graph
traversal, and console reporting). `OBSERVE` is the public observability surface on
the observe and dev builds — `OBSERVE.records`, `OBSERVE.diagnostics`,
`OBSERVE.exclude`, `OBSERVE.server.trace` are for app and tool code; only the
`OBSERVE.attribution` hook slot (`install` / `withInteraction` / `withOrigin`) belongs
to engines, routers, and devtools. Since 2.0.0-rc.9 the folds, queries, and
formatters are **named exports** of that subpath, not methods of `attribution`
(`attribution.why` / `.costs` / `.feedback` / `.subscriptions` / `.format` are type
errors) <!-- upstream:attribution-named-exports -->; `attribution` keeps `enable`, `disable`, `subscribe`, `markFlight`, and the
record ring buffers (`history`, `holds`, `waterfalls`, `navigations`, `interactions`):

```ts
import { attribution, formatRerun, why } from 'solid-js/attribution';
import { isDev } from '@solidjs/web';

if (isDev) attribution.enable({ log: false });
// reproduce the interaction, then ask why a scope ran:
for (const event of why(total)) {
  console.log(formatRerun(event));
}
```

`enable()` pretty-prints every re-run's why-chain to the console by default
(`log: true`); pass `{ log: false }` when you only want the coded findings and plan
to query the tables yourself. Name the scopes you intend to interrogate
(`createMemo(..., { name: "total" })`) — chains refer to nodes by name, and
anonymous nodes print as `computed` / `effect` / `signal`; component labels
(`<Checkout>`) are always present under `vite dev` and survive minification only with
the compiler's `componentNames` option (`solid({ observe: true })` turns it on). On the
**prod build** the import resolves to an inert same-surface twin whose `enable()` is a
no-op, so the import can stay in the code. On the **observe build** it is the real
engine and an unguarded `enable()` records in production — keep the `isDev` guard
unless recording in production is the intent. The split is pay-for-use: importing
`costs` or `feedback` is what turns their tables on, so a records-only consumer
(`attribution.subscribe(...)`) ships neither.

While attribution is enabled, Solid also warns on its own about over-subscription,
chained async waterfalls (`[ASYNC_WATERFALL]`), memos whose fresh-but-equal output
never settles (`[UNSTABLE_MEMO_OUTPUT]`), effects that relay state
(`[EFFECT_RELAY_TEAR]`) or feed their own inputs (`[EFFECT_WRITES_OWN_SOURCE]`),
immutable updates inside stores (`[IMMUTABLE_UPDATE_IN_STORE]` — mutate the draft),
row-rebuilding lists (`[UNSTABLE_LIST_IDENTITY]` — key by id or reconcile into a
store), and silent holds (`[SILENT_HOLD]` — a write held on async work with no
`isPending()` / `latest()` reader, optimistic value, `affects()` mark, or effect that
ran while held; info from 100ms, warning from 200ms, tunable via
`enable({ holds: { infoMs, warnMs } })`). A hold that *was* acknowledged but still ran
long is `[LONG_HOLD]` (info from 500ms, warning from 1000ms;
`enable({ longHolds: { infoMs, warnMs } })`) — the suggestion is a `<Loading on={...}>`
boundary, never removing the hold. `costs()`, `feedback()` (named imports), and
`attribution.holds()` rank the session worst-first; `attribution.waterfalls()`,
`attribution.navigations()`, and `attribution.interactions()` hold the fact tables
behind the verdicts.
`subscriptions(scope)` (named import) lists a scope's current dependencies to compare
against what it uses.

For regression tests, `@solidjs/diagnostics` turns the same channels into assertions:

```ts
import '@solidjs/diagnostics/vitest'; // registers the matchers (or list it in vitest `setupFiles`)
import { captureArtifact } from '@solidjs/diagnostics';

const { artifact } = await captureArtifact(() => {
  fireEvent.click(getByRole('button', { name: 'Add' }));
  flush();
}, { scenario: 'add-item' });

expect(artifact).toHaveNoDiagnostics();
expect(artifact).toHaveNoSilentHolds();
```

`toHaveNoDiagnostics` fails on any coded warning (`info` findings excluded);
`toStayWithinRerunBudget` / `toHaveNoWaste` catch recompute regressions. The
`agent-loops` skill the package ships
(`node_modules/@solidjs/diagnostics/skills/agent-loops/SKILL.md`) documents the agent
verification loops: capture until the channel is quiet, scenario budgets as the
definition of done, and hold/latency gates. See the debugging-reactivity guide in
[references/official-docs.md](references/official-docs.md).

### Development loop: self-diagnose before finishing

Enable observability in development **by default** and lean on it. The dev build
already prints every check; the attribution engine is the part you turn on. Run the
loop whenever a change touches **stores, lists, async computations, actions, or
effects** — a pure markup or styling change does not need it.

1. **Dev console is clean.** Reproduce the change in `vite dev`; zero `[CODE]` entries
   is the bar (`[STRICT_READ_UNTRACKED]`, `[REACTIVE_WRITE_IN_OWNED_SCOPE]`,
   `[ASYNC_STORE_SETTER]`, `[ASYNC_OUTSIDE_LOADING_BOUNDARY]`, …). Fix, do not silence.
2. **Name the scopes you changed** (`createMemo(fn, { name: "total" })`,
   `createStore(v, { name: "cart" })`) so chains and tables refer to them by name.
3. **Record the interaction and ask.** First choice — no app code — is the diagnostics
   endpoint: with `@solidjs/diagnostics` in `devDependencies` at the same version as
   `solid-js` (npm `latest` can lag; `solid2-kit doctor` flags an older one), the Vite plugin's
   `diagnostics` option (auto-on when the package is declared; dev server only, never
   under vitest, `vite build`, or preview) injects the capture bridge and serves
   `/__solid/diagnostics`. `begin` enables attribution with `log: false` for the
   session; `end` disables it and returns the artifact (`diagnostics`,
   `attribution.{reruns, costs, holds, feedback}`, `records`):

   ```sh
   curl -X POST localhost:5173/__solid/diagnostics -d '{"method":"begin"}'
   # ... perform the interaction in the browser ...
   curl -X POST localhost:5173/__solid/diagnostics -d '{"method":"whyDidRun","params":{"name":"total"}}'
   curl -X POST localhost:5173/__solid/diagnostics -d '{"method":"costs"}'
   curl -X POST localhost:5173/__solid/diagnostics -d '{"method":"end"}'   # holds + feedback tables are in the result
   ```

   `GET` the endpoint for status and the method list (`begin` / `end` / `active` /
   `whyDidRun` / `costs` — `feedback` and `holds` come back from `end`). With several
   open tabs the first responder wins, so keep one page under test. Without
   `@solidjs/diagnostics`, the in-code alternative is an `isDev`-guarded
   `attribution.enable({ log: false })` in the client entry, then `why(scope)` /
   `costs()` / `feedback()` from the console or a scratch effect — never `log: true`
   left on (one collapsed `[why-run]` group per re-run) and never unguarded (on the
   observe build it records in production).
4. **Read the verdicts, then the tables.** Fix every coded warning the session raised
   (`[SILENT_HOLD]`, `[IMMUTABLE_UPDATE_IN_STORE]`, `[UNSTABLE_LIST_IDENTITY]`,
   `[EFFECT_RELAY_TEAR]`, `[EFFECT_WRITES_OWN_SOURCE]`, `[ASYNC_WATERFALL]`,
   `[HOT_SCOPE_RERUNS]`). Then `costs().scopes` (self time, `wastedMs` for runs whose
   result did not change), `costs().writes` (root writes by downstream work),
   `feedback().sources` / `.interactions` / `.flights` / `.fallbacks` (silent holds,
   held time per interaction, abandoned requests, fallback flashes). A scope that
   re-runs more than its inputs change is a `why(scope)` question — the chain names the
   write, the changed dependency, and the time.
5. **Make it a test when it is worth keeping**: `captureArtifact` +
   `toHaveNoDiagnostics()` / `toHaveNoSilentHolds()` / `toStayWithinRerunBudget(n,
   { scope })` is the definition of done for the scenario you just tuned.

The bundled `agent-loops` skill (`node_modules/@solidjs/diagnostics/skills/agent-loops/SKILL.md`)
is the long form of this loop; `solid2-kit init` prints the devDependency note when it
runs in a project.

### Production observability: the observe build

Everything above is the dev build. Records, traces, and attribution in **production**
need the observe build, opted into per project — and it changes nothing under `vite dev`:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import solid from '@solidjs/vite-plugin';

export default { plugins: [solid({ ssr: true, observe: true })] };
```

`observe: true` adds the `observe` condition to every environment (client and server,
`vite build` and preview) and turns on the compiler's `componentNames` option so
`ownerPath` / `boundaryPath` name components instead of `computed`. Without the plugin,
set `resolve.conditions` (or `node --conditions=observe` for an unbundled server) and
`componentNames` yourself. Cost in Solid's size suite: ~16.8 KB against ~15.3 KB brotli
for a small client app; importing the attribution engine on top raises the cap to
~27 KB (a separate entry — an observe build that never imports it never ships it). The
two error hooks are **not** part of this: they fire on every build, prod included, only
the paths are `undefined` there.

- **Instrumentation order.** A monitoring SDK's `init()` (and `configureServerErrors`)
  must run before the modules it patches load. `import "./instrument"` at the top of an
  entry does not achieve that in ESM (static imports are hoisted in dependency order);
  the plugin's `start: { instrument: "./src/instrument.ts" }` awaits that server-only
  module before anything else in the server graph.
- **Tracing.** The server continues an incoming W3C `traceparent` or originates one;
  `getTraceContext()` from `@solidjs/web` reads it during the request (in-process
  server-function calls included) — forward it downstream with
  `headers: { ...getTraceContext()?.entries }`. The browser is told which trace the page
  belongs to on `Server-Timing` and `<meta>` tags, but only when the incoming trace was
  sampled or a provider answered; a page with no tracing tool sees no wire change. On
  the observe build a tracing SDK supplies the trace with
  `OBSERVE?.server.trace.provide((request) => ({ traceId, spanId, entries }))`, once per
  request. Do not write middleware to inject trace headers.
- **Records.** `OBSERVE?.records.subscribe(type, (event, live) => …)` delivers one plain
  record per `"boundary"` (a `<Loading>` that waited on the server), `"invocation"`
  (server-function execution), `"call"` (server-function call from the page — shares
  `id` with its invocation), and `"frame"` (produced / applied). Records are
  serializable data; live handles (request, args, the error as thrown) ride in the
  second argument. Listeners run synchronously inside the runtime, **must not write
  signals**, and should subscribe from a module that loads before the app.
- **Interactions.** `attribution.enable()` then
  `attribution.subscribe("interaction", (event) => …)` says what each click waited on
  (`event.settledMs`, `event.holds[].blockers`, `event.holds[].holdMs`); a hold nothing acknowledged
  is the dead click. The fold tables stay separate imports.
- **What leaves the process.** Beyond names, four record fields carry page data —
  `target` (element as `tag#id "text"`, 30 chars), `prev` / `value` previews (40 chars),
  navigation `to` / `from` / `params`, and `data.error` on server render findings — an
  exporter decides what to do with each. A tool that renders inside the app it watches
  (devtools panel) marks its root with `OBSERVE?.exclude(getOwner()!)` inside its
  `createRoot` so its own effects and stores never become findings; do not route its
  writes through `runWithOwner` (that is a write in an owned scope).

## Client mode: no server HTML, no hydration reflexes

The `@solidjs/vite-plugin` default (client mode, the `bare` tier) serves an empty-body
shell and mounts with `render()`. Nothing is server-rendered and nothing hydrates, so
**React's hydration-mismatch playbook does not transfer**: do not start signals with a
"server-safe" initial value and adopt `localStorage` / `matchMedia` after mount, do not
two-pass render, and there is no `suppressHydrationWarning`. Read client sources directly
when creating state — `createSignal(storedPreference())` is correct in client mode. A
deferred "safe" initial value is worse than unnecessary: if anything persists the value
(an effect writing `localStorage`), the placeholder **overwrites the user's stored
preference** before the real value is adopted. Mismatch only becomes a concept in
start/SSR mode, where `hydrate()` mounts onto server HTML — and the Solid answer there is
`isServer` / `clientOnly` / per-value `ssrSource`, still not React-style deferred adoption.

## App stack (only if the project has these packages)

This kit's always-applied rules cover `solid-js` + `@solidjs/web` TSX. Official
Solid 2 docs also describe optional app layers. **If those packages are in the
project, use them — do not invent Next.js, React Router, SolidStart 1.x, or
Solid Router 0.x/1.x stand-ins.** Patterns below; fetch the matching pages from
[references/official-docs.md](references/official-docs.md).

### Compiler / packages

```json
{ "compilerOptions": { "jsx": "preserve", "jsxImportSource": "@solidjs/web" } }
```

`solid-js` does **not** export a `JSX` namespace — `import type { JSX } from "solid-js"`
is a type error (TS2305) <!-- upstream:jsx-namespace-absent -->. Markup types are `JSX.Element` from `@solidjs/web` (the
docs' choice; it also admits DOM nodes) or the renderer-neutral `Element` from `solid-js`
(`children?: Element`), alongside `Component` / `ParentProps` / `Accessor` / `Setter`.
Import the latter as `import type { Element as SolidElement } from "solid-js"` in any file
that also uses DOM elements — unaliased, it shadows the DOM `Element`
(`el.getBoundingClientRect()` becomes TS2339). DOM-specific `JSX` types
(`JSX.IntrinsicElements`, `JSX.CSSProperties`) and `ComponentProps` come from
`@solidjs/web`. Vite: `import solid from "@solidjs/vite-plugin"`
with `start: true` / `ssr: true` / `serverFunctions: true` only when the
project already uses start mode. Tiers are `bare` → `basic` (router) →
`fullstack` (SSR + server functions); do not jump a tier without cause.
Under `start: true` the plugin owns entries and the build — write `src/App.tsx`, not
SolidStart-style `entry-client.tsx` / `entry-server.tsx` (authored ones replace the
generated entries) or a hand-written `index.html`. The document shell (`<html lang>`,
favicon, fallback `<title>`) is an optional `src/Document.tsx` default export that renders
`<HydrationScript />` in `<head>` and `<body>{props.children}</body>`; `App` never renders
`<html>`.

### Solid Router 2 — `createRouter`, not JSX `<Route>`

```tsx
import { Loading, lazy } from 'solid-js';
import { createRouter } from '@solidjs/router';

export const Router = createRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/', component: lazy(() => import('./pages/Home')) },
    { path: '/about', component: lazy(() => import('./pages/About')) },
    { path: '*404', component: lazy(() => import('./pages/NotFound')) },
  ],
});
export const { paths } = Router;

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      {(props) => (
        <>
          <a href={Router.paths}>Home</a>
          <Loading fallback={<p>Loading…</p>}>
            <main>{props.children}</main>
          </Loading>
        </>
      )}
    </Router>
  );
}
```

The `<Loading>` covers the first load of the lazy pages (and lets SSR stream the shell);
later navigations hold the current page while the next one loads (links get
`data-pending`). Create the instance at **module scope**. Nested layouts are `children` arrays
on the route objects, not nested `<Route>` / nested routers. Solid Router does
**not** support nested `<Router>` instances — compose one route tree (or a lazy
`children` thunk). Navigate with
plain `<a href={Router.paths.about}>` (or `useNavigate`); there is no `<A>` /
`<Navigate>` / `<HashRouter>` / `<FileRoutes />`. Do not assign
`window.location.href` or call `history.pushState` for in-app navigation.
Session location is `useLocation` / `useParams`,
not `Router.paths`.

**Route `preload` starts reads; the page reads them in a memo.** `preload` runs when
the route matches (and on link hover), so it should kick off the query and return
nothing; the component reads the same query through a memo that tracks the params:

```tsx
// src/data/products.ts
import { query } from '@solidjs/router';

export const getProduct = query(async (id: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/products/${id}`);
  return (await response.json()) as Product;
}, 'product');

// src/router.ts — defineRoute types params from the path (params.id: string)
import { lazy } from 'solid-js';
import { createRouter, defineRoute } from '@solidjs/router';
import { getProduct } from './data/products';

export const Router = createRouter({
  routes: [
    defineRoute({
      path: '/products/:id',
      preload: ({ params }) => void getProduct(params.id),
      component: lazy(() => import('./pages/Product')),
    }),
  ],
});

// src/pages/Product.tsx
import { createMemo } from 'solid-js';
import type { RouteProps } from '@solidjs/router';
import { getProduct } from '../data/products';

export default function ProductPage(props: RouteProps<'/products/:id'>) {
  const product = createMemo(() => getProduct(props.params.id));
  return <h1>{product().name}</h1>;
}
```

Do not return the data from `preload` and render `props.data` (the Remix-loader
shape): `props.data` is whatever `preload` returned when the route first matched, so
navigating `/products/mug` → `/products/bowl` keeps showing the mug, and an `async`
preload makes it a Promise (`props.data.name` is TS2339). Return a value only for
data that stays fixed while the route is matched. The factory `preload` on
`createRouter` runs once per mount/request; its result is the root render prop's
`props.data`. Plain route objects type `params` as an open record (`string |
undefined` per key) — wrap a route in `defineRoute` when `preload` or the component
needs `params.id: string`.

Link warming: `preload="false"` skips that link's *data* preload; `preloadLinks: false`
disables automatic link preloading. Intent values are `"initial"` / `"navigate"` /
`"native"` / `"preload"`. One router per app.

Link state needs no component code: the router sets `aria-current="page"` (exact
match), `data-active` (exact or descendant — the `/` link is active only on exact
match), and `data-pending` (in-flight navigation target) on the anchors it handles;
style them in CSS. For non-anchors, or state needed in JSX, `useLinkState(() => href,
{ end })` returns the same three as accessors (`active` / `current` / `pending`);
`useIsRouting()` is the page-level pending flag for progress bars. Hand-rolled
`location.pathname === ...` comparisons are the wrong tool.

Build URLs from `paths`: static segments are properties (`Router.paths.about`, never
`Router.paths.about()`), parameterized segments are calls (`paths.products(id)`),
followed by an optional search object and hash (`paths.search({ q, page }, "results")`).
Nodes stringify in `href` / `navigate()` / `redirect()`, so call with no arguments
only when an API insists on a plain string.

Search params are the home for shareable state (filter, sort, page): `const [search,
setSearch] = useSearchParams()` — the setter merges and navigates without scrolling;
`""` / `undefined` / `null` removes a key. For typed values, put a synchronous
Standard Schema on the route's `search` field and pass the path node:
`useSearchParams(Router.paths.search)` (async schemas throw; a failing schema leaves
the raw strings rather than throwing). Query values are strings, so coerce in the schema —
`page: v.optional(v.pipe(v.unknown(), v.transform(Number)), 1)`; a plain `v.number()`
rejects every value and hands back the string, still typed `number`.

**Two different `action`s.** Core `action` from `solid-js` is a generator transaction
(optimistic writes that span an async gap). Router `action` from `@solidjs/router` is
a URL-addressable POST mutation (`useSubmissions`, `<form action={save} method="post">`).
Do not import one and use it as the other.

```tsx
import { action } from '@solidjs/router';
import { redirect } from '@solidjs/web';

const save = action(async (form: FormData) => {
  await saveProfile(form);
  return redirect('/account');
}, 'update-profile');

<form action={save} method="post">
  <input name="displayName" />
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

Only POST forms are accepted. Bind extra args with `.with(id)` (they go in the
action URL). `onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); fetch(...) }}` *runs* and
drops the no-JS form fallback. `useAction` is JS-only for the same reason.
Optimistic rows for a router form keep the `<form>` and add no core `action`: read the
list `query` with `createOptimisticStore(() => getList(), [])` and register
`save.onSubmit((form) => setList((d) => { d.push({ …, pending: true }); }))` in the
component — the hook runs inside the action's transaction, so the row is an overlay,
replaced on settle by the revalidated `query` (a plain server-function read is not
revalidated, so the row just disappears).
`useSubmissions` keeps only completions with a result or error; observe void and
redirect completions with `save.onSettled(hook)`.

Validated forms come in three passes sharing one HTML shape. Pass 1 (above) posts
uncontrolled inputs with browser `required` / `pattern` — it works with no JavaScript.
Pass 2 validates on the server, where the user cannot bypass it:

```ts
import { redirect, respond } from '@solidjs/web';
import * as v from 'valibot';

const Address = v.object({
  postalCode: v.pipe(v.string(), v.regex(/^[0-9]{5}$/, 'Enter a five-digit postal code')),
});
export type AddressIssues = Partial<Record<'postalCode', string>>;

export async function saveAddress(form: FormData) {
  'use server';
  const parsed = v.safeParse(Address, Object.fromEntries(form));
  if (!parsed.success) {
    const issues: AddressIssues = {};
    for (const issue of parsed.issues) {
      const field = issue.path?.[0]?.key as keyof AddressIssues | undefined;
      if (field && !issues[field]) issues[field] = issue.message;
    }
    throw respond({ issues }, { status: 400 });
  }
  await database.addresses.save(parsed.output);
  return redirect('/checkout/shipping');
}
```

Keep server functions in `src/data/`, not under `src/routes` (with method discovery
on, a `.ts` file there is an API route). `throw respond(...)` is intentional control
flow — the status and value survive production sanitization, unlike a plain thrown
`Error`. Pass 3 renders the messages inline from the recorded submission:

```tsx
import { action, useSubmissions } from '@solidjs/router';

const submitAddress = action(saveAddress);
const submissions = useSubmissions(submitAddress);
const issues = () => (submissions.at(-1)?.error as { issues?: AddressIssues } | undefined)?.issues ?? {};

<Show when={issues().postalCode}>{(message) => <p role="alert">{message()}</p>}</Show>
```

`issues()` is a plain derived function; `aria-invalid` on the input, `role="alert"`
on the message. Redirect outcomes do not stay in the list; the no-JS outcome arrives
via flash cookie as the same submission shape. Pending state is CSS on the automatic
attribute — `form[aria-busy] button[type="submit"] { opacity: .6 }` — no component
code. `submission.clear()` on dismiss/resubmit only, never from an effect (errors
would flash and vanish). Live per-keystroke validation is a controlled input plus a
memo message (`aria-live="polite"`), keeping `name` so `FormData` still works; leave
the rest uncontrolled.

**`query` is the read cache** (optional, only with the router). Wrap a read,
give it a stable name, and consume it through a Solid async primitive:

```tsx
import { createMemo } from 'solid-js';
import { query, revalidate } from '@solidjs/router';

export const getUser = query(async (id: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
  return response.json();
}, 'users');

const user = createMemo(() => getUser(params.id));
// after a mutation:
revalidate(getUser.key);
revalidate(getUser.keyFor('42'));
```

A bare `createMemo(async () => fetchUser(id()))` still works; it just has no
shared cache, no preload reuse, and no `revalidate`. Do not wrap mutations in
`query` — wrapping an undeclared server function makes it GET. `query.get(key)`
throws if there is no entry; `query.set` does not accept a promise. Cache is
request-scoped on the server and application-scoped in the browser. After a
router mutation, `revalidate(...)` — not core `refresh()`, and not
`reload()` (that is a *server-function return* that asks the integration to
refresh cached data: `return reload({ revalidate: "todos" })`). `live()` sources
update through the open stream; do not `revalidate` them. Replace SolidStart /
Router 0.x leftovers: no `createAsync`, `useSubmission` (singular), `cache()`,
router `json()`, or `<FileRoutes />` (`fileRoutes(pageRoutes)` from `@solidjs/router/fs`
over `pageRoutes` from `virtual:file-routes` instead).

### Server functions — `"use server"`

```ts
export async function findUser(id: string) {
  'use server';
  // validate `id`; read identity from getRequestEvent(), never from arguments
  return database.users.find(id);
}
```

A function-level server function cannot close over component locals — pass
values as arguments. Treat every argument as untrusted — TypeScript does not
cross the HTTP boundary, so do not invent tRPC / RPC type-gen;
validate inside the function (a parse in the function body is that
validation, not an RPC schema across the wire). Checks belong in the body: HTTP dispatch
calls a function-level `"use server"` body directly, so a HOF around it (`withAuth(fn)`,
`validated(schema, fn)`) runs for in-process calls and is skipped for `curl` — an auth
bypass. A wrapper inside a file-level `"use server"` module (`export const x =
withAccount(async …)`) is what gets registered and does run. Arguments are capped at 1 MiB
by default (413 beyond; the host's `bodySizeLimit`) — upload large files to a signed URL.
Never hand a server function point-free to a library callback (`mutationFn: renameUser`,
`onClick={deleteTodo}`): every argument the callback receives (a context object, the
event) is sent over the wire — wrap it in an arrow that passes only the data. These functions *are* the RPC — do not add an
API-route file (or a Next `route.ts`) just to wrap `db.todos.insert`. API
routes are for real HTTP endpoints (webhooks, third-party POST), not for the
app's own RPC. Read trusted identity
from `getRequestEvent()`, never from a caller-supplied user id. During SSR the same
reference runs in-process (no HTTP); in the browser it is HTTP. Anything
referenced only inside the `"use server"` body (db client, secrets) never
reaches the client — the directive is the privacy boundary. Mutations that should
revalidate: `redirect` / `reload` from `@solidjs/web` (see the server-function
guides).

**`redirect()` / `reload()` are signals for an integration, not navigation.** Solid
Router's `action` / `query` apply them (navigate, revalidate), and a no-JS form post
follows the 302. Any other caller — a core `action`, an event handler, a plain
`createMemo(() => listOrders())` — receives the raw `Response` as the resolved value:
no navigation happens, and the type still claims your data. (When a mounted router's
single-flight hook intercepts a direct POST call, it does navigate, but the call
resolves to `null`; a direct `GET()` read always gets the `Response`.) Either way the
caller never gets its data, so the redirect guard belongs to functions called through
the router:

```ts
import { getRequestEvent, redirect, respond } from '@solidjs/web';

// called through a router action/query: the router navigates to /sign-in
export async function listOrders() {
  'use server';
  const userId = getRequestEvent()?.locals.userId;
  if (!userId) throw redirect('/sign-in');
  return database.orders.forUser(userId);
}

// no router in the project (core action + server functions): reject instead
export async function listMyOrders() {
  'use server';
  const userId = getRequestEvent()?.locals.userId;
  if (!userId) throw respond(null, { status: 401 });
  return database.orders.forUser(userId);
}
```

Without the router, fail with `throw respond(..., { status })` (the call rejects and
`<Errored>` / the action's `catch` sees it), or return a value and navigate in the
caller. Return a redirect when it is the successful outcome, throw it for an early
exit. `redirect()` and `respond()` accept the same `revalidate`
option as `reload()` when the mutation also changes location or returns a value;
`revalidate: REVALIDATE_ALL` (`"*"`, from `@solidjs/web`) declares every cache entry
stale, distinct from omitting it (the host's default) and from `[]` (nothing). After a router/server mutation do **not** follow with a client `fetch`
to "refresh the page" — `reload` / `revalidate` (and the router's single-flight
response) close that loop. For 404 during SSR: `httpStatus(404)` from `@solidjs/web`.
`throw new Error("…")` is stripped to `"Internal Server Error"` in production —
on the server-function wire **and**, since 2.0.0-rc.9, on every SSR road a failure
takes (an `<Errored>` fallback rendered on the server, a rejected async source
serialized into the stream, a `<Loading>` fragment's rejection), so `err().message`
in a fallback reads the generic message in a production server render. <!-- upstream:ssr-error-sanitized --> Use
`throw markSafeError(...)` or `throw respond(..., { status })` for intentional
client-facing failures — a *returned* `respond()` resolves the call whatever its
status, so `return respond({ error }, { status: 400 })` reads as success to the UI,
`useSubmissions`, and the optimistic overlay. Do not `return Response.json(...)` from
`"use server"` — that is HTTP-handler control flow; `return respond(value, { status: 201 })`
is success metadata a scripted caller unwraps. Arguments are JSON: send `Date` / `Map` /
`Set` as ISO strings / arrays (they throw otherwise; one `File` / `Blob` / `FormData`
argument travels natively). `enableRichArguments()` from
`@solidjs/web/server-functions/rich-args` (at `src/App.tsx` module scope) lifts that, but
in rc.9 importing it fails `vite build` (`"./client" is not exported` — the dev server
works, so the break shows only at build); `resolve: { dedupe: ["@solidjs/web"] }` in the
Vite config works around it. <!-- upstream:rich-args-vite-build https://github.com/solidjs/solid/issues/3627 -->
`GET()` is only for idempotent reads (URLs leak into logs/history);
import it from `@solidjs/web/server-functions`, never `@solidjs/start`.
Reads are function calls too: `GET(async (id) => { "use server"; ... })` is invoked
as `await getUser(id)` — Solid owns the endpoint, serialization, and decoding, the
database access stays on the server, and argument/return types flow to the caller.
The HTTP method mirrors the operation (reads GET, mutations POST); when encoded
arguments would exceed the URL limit the client falls back to a read-only POST.
Cache GET reads with HTTP, not a hand-rolled Solid cache: responses default to
`Cache-Control: no-store`, so supply the policy via `respond()` — the caller still
receives the value; headers ride the transport.

```ts
import { respond } from '@solidjs/web';
import { GET } from '@solidjs/web/server-functions';

export const fetchStory = GET(async (id: number) => {
  'use server';
  const story = await db.stories.find(id);
  return respond(story, {
    headers: { 'cache-control': 'public, max-age=60, s-maxage=300' },
  });
});
```

A value that changes over time is `live(GET(fn))` — **`live()` outermost**: `GET()`
chooses the read transport and `live()` wraps the call behavior around it. `live()`
does not imply `GET()`; without it the source streams over POST, which is fine when a
cacheable URL is of no use.

```ts
// src/data/auction.ts
import { GET, live } from '@solidjs/web/server-functions';

export const liveAuction = live(
  GET(async function* (id: string) {
    'use server';
    yield await db.auctions.find(id); // current state first, from storage
    for await (const _change of db.auctions.subscribe(id)) {
      yield await db.auctions.find(id);
    }
  }),
);

export async function saveBid(id: string, amount: number) {
  'use server';
  await db.bids.place(id, amount);
}
```

A plain `async function*` server function (no `live()`) is a different tool: an
**event sequence** on one connection, consumed with `for await` and accumulated. When
that connection drops, the iteration ends with an error and nothing reopens it; ending
the iteration in the browser aborts the request and fires the server's
`request.signal`. Use it for an order's status history; use `live()` when each value
replaces the previous one.

`live()` yields **current state** (each yield replaces the last); do not treat
it as an append-only event log. A reconnect calls the function again and its first
yield replaces the stale answer, so read that first value from the state mutations write
to (database, shared server state) — not from generator locals or per-connection memory. Until the first yield it is unsettled
(`<Loading>`), same as a Promise; later yields are updates — the fallback does
not return.
Wire status is a side channel on the **iterable the `live()` call returns**,
not a field in the value and not a property of the memo:

```ts
const source = stockPrice("ACME");
source.onstatus = (next) => setStatus(next);
const price = createMemo(() => source);
```

Do not yield `{ price, connected: true }`. After the first successful connection,
transient failures retry with exponential backoff; a 4xx is a definite rejection.
There is no subscription API and no store wiring to configure. For a reactive
argument, call `live()` inside the memo so the input is tracked:
`createMemo(() => stockPrice(props.symbol))`. Every reader of that memo shares
one connection — hoist it instead of calling `live()` at each site. Do not
subscribe/unsubscribe in the component around `live()`. The `live()` generator
may still subscribe to an upstream source.

**The graph continues across the wire.** An in-flight Promise serializes as a
Promise and resolves in the client graph as it settles — including before the
bundle has loaded. A `live()` source sends its first value in the HTML then
picks up the stream. Do not refetch in `onSettled` / `hydrate` to "load for the
client", and do not delay `renderToStream` to preserve visual order — `<Reveal>`
controls when content *appears*, while HTML still ships as soon as it is ready.
With the router's single-flight integration, a mutation response can seed the
destination route's preloads; that is the refresh, not a follow-up `fetch`.
When the app has a server bundle (`ssr` or server functions), production is
`handleRequest(request)` from the built `dist/server/server.js` (or that
module's Fetchable default `fetch`) — not an import from `solid-js`. Cloudflare /
Netlify / Nitro Vite plugins adopt that handler — do not write a Solid adapter,
a custom Worker, or a Netlify Function. For Node, set `start: { node: true }` and run
`node dist/server/node.js` (serves `dist/client`, reads `PORT` / `HOST`); inside an
existing Express / Fastify app, mount the `listener` that file exports — do not
hand-write a Node↔web bridge (`node dist/server/server.js` starts nothing: it is the
handler module). Client-only `start: true` is still static `dist/client`
— there is no handler to wrap. Request middleware is the Vite option
`start: { middleware: "./src/middleware.ts" }` (web `Request` + `next`), not
Express `app.use`. Server functions that return components
(`serverFunctions: { components: true }`) are experimental preview — do not use
them unless the project already has that flag on.

Unscripted (no-JS) POST forms go through a router action —
`const save = action(createTodo, "create-todo")` from `@solidjs/router`, then
`<form action={save} method="post">` — not a client `preventDefault` + `fetch`, not a
hand-built `/_server/` URL, and not `action={createTodo.url}`: a bare `"use server"`
function keeps its declared function type, so `.url` is a type error (TS2339) even
though it exists at runtime (and `serverFunctionActionUrl(createTodo)` is TS2345).
The post arrives as one `FormData` argument, so the function behind `action={save}`
takes `(form: FormData)` and parses and validates the fields inside; any other
signature makes `action={save}` a type error (TS2322). Bind leading JSON-safe
arguments with `action={save.with(id)}` for `(id: string, form: FormData)`; a function
that already has a typed signature gets a separate `FormData` server function that
parses and calls it.
`.url` is typed only on `GET()` / `live()` references, which makes it the address of a
`method="get"` search form (`action={searchProducts.url}`; the function receives the
fields as `URLSearchParams`). GET forms are only for idempotent search — do not use a
GET form for a mutation.

### Document head — no MetaProvider

```tsx
import { Title, Link, Meta } from '@solidjs/meta';

<Title>Page title</Title>
<Meta name="description" content="..." />
```

Solid Meta 1.x has **no provider**. Render tags anywhere; later wins, unmount
restores. `useHead` from `@solidjs/web` is the lower-level registry — prefer
`<Title>` / `<Meta>` / `<Script>` (JSON-LD) for application metadata. Several
tags that should swap as one unit belong in `<Head>`. A static `<title>`
in the document shell is the fallback when no `<Title>` is mounted; do not
hardcode a second `<meta name="description">` (the registry leaves foreign tags
alone, so both would coexist). Do not hardcode a second `<title>` in the document shell.

## These still run — write the other form

Official docs (and the compiler) allow several of these. They are the wrong
tool: they snapshot, drop subscriptions, or rebuild work Solid already knows
how to reuse. Prefer the form on the right.

| Compiles / renders | Write this |
|---|---|
| `{todos().map((t) => <Row todo={t} />)}` | `<For each={todos()} keyed={(t) => t.id}>` |
| `<For each={todos().map(t => t)}>` | derive first, then `<For each={visible()}>` |
| `class={`btn ${on() ? "on" : ""}`}` / `clsx("btn", on() && "on")` / `.filter(Boolean).join(" ")` | `class={["btn", { on: on() }]}` |
| `style={{ width: 80 }}` (no unit) | `style={{ width: `${80}px` }}` |
| `const rest = { ...props }` | `const rest = omit(props, "label")` |
| `const user = createMemo(async () => { await fetch(...); return id(); })` | read `id()` **before** `await` |
| `action(async function* () { await save(); setX(v); })` | `yield save()` or `await save(); yield; setX(v)` |
| `action(async (item) => { ... })` with core `action` from `solid-js` | `action(function* (item) { ...; yield ...; ... })` — only a generator re-enters the transaction (`solid2-kit check` flags this). Router `action` from `@solidjs/router` is the one that takes `async (form) => ...` |
| `todos()` on a store | `todos.length` / `todo.title` (property reads) |
| `todos.push(x)` / `state.count++` / `todo.done = !todo.done` on the store itself | `setTodos((draft) => { draft.push(x); })` — writes to the store proxy outside a setter are silently ignored (no error, no warning, tsc passes) |
| `createStore({ selected: new Set<string>() })` + `draft.selected.add(id)` | `selected: {} as Record<string, true>` + `draft.selected[id] = true` / `delete draft.selected[id]`, or `draft.selected = new Set([...draft.selected, id])` — `Map` / `Set` / `Date` are stored as-is, not tracked |
| `draft.todos = fresh` (wholesale fresh-tree assignment) | `reconcile(fresh, "id")`, or function-form `createStore` / `createProjection` (auto-keyed by `"id"`). Removal via `setTodos((t) => t.filter(...))` is fine — survivors keep identity |
| `createEffect(() => user, (u) => { log(u.name); })` | `createEffect(() => user.name, (name) => { log(name); })` |
| `createEffect(() => title(), (t) => (document.title = t))` / `(v) => setX(v)` | `(t) => { document.title = t; }` — apply returns a cleanup or nothing; any other return value halts reactivity. An apply that only calls a local setter is rule 4 even with braces (`solid2-kit check` flags it): use a (writable) derivation |
| `<Loading fallback={<PageSkeleton />}>{/* header + data */}</Loading>` | wrap only the data slot; chrome stays outside |
| `<Loading on={id} fallback={...}>` (the accessor) | `on={id()}` — a value, so identity changes can show fallback |
| `setCount(count() + 1)` when writes can batch | `setCount((c) => c + 1)` |
| `setHandler(fn)` to store a function | `setHandler(() => fn)` (otherwise `fn` is an updater) |
| `{user() ? <P user={user()!} /> : <SignIn />}` | `<Show when={user()}>{(u) => <P user={u()} />}</Show>` |
| `const u = user(); return <Child user={u} />` / `user: Promise<User>` / `user: Accessor<User>` as the default | `<Child user={user()} />` and `{props.user.name}` under `<Loading>` — types stay `User`. Pass the memo itself only when the child must `refresh()` that source. `isPending(() => props.user)` works on the value |
| `lazy(() => import("./p").then((m) => ({ default: m.About })))` | `lazy(() => import("./p"), { export: "About" })` |
| `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html }}` | `innerHTML={html()}` (sanitized); never with JSX children |
| `onClick={setCount}` | `onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}` |
| `event.target.value` | `event.currentTarget.value` |
| `createContext(emptyStore)` for reactive state | `createContext<Todos>()` — dummy defaults silently no-op |
| `<For keyed={(t) => t.id}>{(todo) => todo.title}` | `todo().title` — key-function items are accessors |
| `{list().length ? <For each={list()}> : <Empty />}` | `<For each={list()} fallback={<Empty />}>` |
| `<For each={rows.slice(from, from + n)}>` | `<Repeat from={from()} count={n}>` |
| `{count() && <Badge />}` | `<Show when={count()}>` — `0` must not render as text |
| `throw new Error("expired")` from a server function (prod) | `throw markSafeError(...)` or `throw respond(body, { status })` |
| `const r = await api.x(); if (!r.ok) ...` result-object checks at every read | throw unusable responses; contain each region with `<Errored>` |
| `GET(async (id) => { "use server"; await db.delete(id) })` | mutations stay on POST; `GET()` is for idempotent reads |
| `live()` yields as an event log to append | each yield **replaces** the current answer; yield current state first, read from the state mutations write to — a reconnect calls the function again, so generator locals or per-connection memory are not the source |
| `GET(live(async function* () { ... }))` | `live(GET(async function* () { ... }))` — `live()` outermost; `live()` alone streams over POST |
| a plain `async function*` `"use server"` stream for a value that must survive a dropped connection | `live()` — a plain stream is an event sequence on one connection (`for await`, accumulate); nothing reopens it when it drops |
| `yield saveBid(...)` then `refresh(auction)` on a store derived from `live()` | `yield saveBid(...); yield until(() => auction.highBid >= amount, { timeout })` — `live()` is outside revalidation/single-flight; `refresh` re-runs the derivation (closes the stream, calls the source again): a reconnect per mutation, and the old value still flashes back whenever the new first value predates the write |
| `<article innerHTML={html()}>…children…</article>` | `innerHTML` **or** children, not both |
| `fallback={(error) => <p>{error.message}</p>}` | `error` is an accessor: `error().message` (or `String(error())`) |
| `import { action } from "solid-js"` on a `<form>` | `import { action } from "@solidjs/router"` + `<form action={save} method="post">` (core `action` is a generator transaction, not a form URL) |
| `createMemo(async () => fetchUser(id()))` when `@solidjs/router` is present | `query(fetchUser, "users")` + `createMemo(() => getUser(id()))`; after mutations `revalidate(getUser.key)`, not core `refresh()` |
| `onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); fetch(...) }}` for a router/server action | `<form action={save} method="post">` (POST only; `.with(id)` binds args into the URL). `useAction` is JS-only |
| `query(saveUser, "users")` wrapping a mutation | don't wrap mutations in `query` — an undeclared server function becomes GET |
| `render(<App />, root)` / Testing Library `render(<Counter />)` | `render(() => <App />, root)` — pass a function so Solid creates the root first |
| `render` onto SSR HTML / `hydrate` into an empty node | `hydrate(() => <App />, root)` when HTML already exists; `render` for an empty mount |
| `renderToString(() => <App />)` for an async or lazy-route tree | `await renderToStream(() => <App />)` (one consumer: `pipe` / `pipeTo` / `readable`). String render emits `<Loading>` fallbacks |
| `clientOnly(() => import("./Map"))` for a rarely shown widget | same + `{ lazy: true }` so the import waits until first render (default starts at declaration) |
| `<NoHydration><Chart /></NoHydration>` to skip SSR of a widget | `clientOnly(() => import("./Chart"))` — `NoHydration`/`Hydration` split ownership, they do not choose visible content |
| `clientOnly` split (or `isServer` branch) for one browser-only *value* | `createMemo(() => localStorage.getItem(k), { ssrSource: "client" })` — `"hybrid"` when server data mixes with client signals |
| `await flush()` / `flush()` to wait on a pending memo | `await resolve(() => value())` (or Testing Library async queries); `flush()` only drains staged *sync* writes |
| `action(function* () { setX(v); })` around a navigation-shaped setter | plain setter; async computeds hold previous values. Core `action` only when writes happen *after* async work |
| `export const [cart, setCart] = createStore(...)` for app-wide state | `createCart()` called by a `CartProvider` at the root of `App`, read with `useCart()` over `createContext<T>()` — module state has no owner and, under SSR, one instance serves every request (`[SERVER_WRITE]`). Module scope is for constants and `createContext` |
| `import { GET } from "@solidjs/start"` / `createAsync` / `useSubmission` / `<FileRoutes />` / `"use client"` | `GET` from `@solidjs/web/server-functions`; `createMemo(() => getUser(id()))`; `useSubmissions`; `fileRoutes(pageRoutes)`; Solid has no `"use client"` |
| `<Show keyed when={user()}>` by default | default `Show` (keeps children mounted); `keyed` only when internal state must reset |
| overlapping truthy `<Match>`es all expected to render | first truthy `<Match>` wins; later matches are skipped |
| missing `<HydrationScript />` / one script for many roots | once, before app markup, when the app owns the document; distinct `renderId` per extra root |
| `Router.paths` as the current URL | `useLocation` / `useParams` |
| `preload: async ({ params }) => getProduct(params.id)` + `props.data.name` in the page | `preload: ({ params }) => void getProduct(params.id)` + `createMemo(() => getProduct(props.params.id))` — `props.data` is captured once when the route matches (stale on param change; a Promise for async preloads) |
| `query.get(key)` with no guaranteed entry; `query.set(key, promise)` | `query.get` throws if missing; `query.set` does not accept a promise |
| `onCleanup(() => ...)` in a component body | `onSettled(() => { ...; return cleanup })` — `onCleanup` is for custom primitives |
| `onSettled` with reactive reads expecting re-runs | each call is a **single** fire; reads are untracked. Ongoing work is `createEffect`, created in the component body |
| `onSettled(() => { const id = setInterval(tick, 1000); onCleanup(() => clearInterval(id)); })` | `onSettled(() => { const id = setInterval(tick, 1000); return () => clearInterval(id); })` — `onCleanup`, `createMemo` / `createEffect`, and `flush()` throw inside the callback |
| `<Router>` nested inside `<Router>` | one instance; nest `children` arrays (or a lazy children thunk) |
| `const View = tab() ? A : B; return <View />` | `const View = dynamic(() => (tab() ? A : B))` — the ternary at setup freezes the choice |
| `<For each={resolved()}>` after `children()` | `{resolved.toArray()}` — resolved children are not a reactive data list |
| `<input onChange={...}>` for keystrokes | `onInput` — native `onChange` is blur/commit |
| debounce as an effect copying one signal into another | debounce at the handler: `onInput={debounce((e) => setQuery(e.currentTarget.value), 150)}` |
| `value={query()}` on a search box whose writes feed a request | `value={latest(query)}` so keystrokes show while the write is held (uncontrolled needs nothing) |
| `createOptimistic` for a local edit draft | writable derivation / plain store. Optimistic is for an in-flight mutation |
| `createMemo(async fn, { loadingValue })` / `{ seedLoadingValue: true }` as the default first-flight UI | `<Loading>` for first flight; those options are escape hatches (store projections use `seedLoadingValue`) |
| `setSubmitted(true)` + an effect that watches it | do the work in the handler or an `action` |
| `findUser(userId)` with the id from the client as identity | `const userId = getRequestEvent()?.locals.userId; if (!userId) throw respond(null, { status: 401 });` (`throw redirect("/sign-in")` under a router `action` / `query`) |
| `action={"/_server/" + id}` / `action={createTodo.url}` on a POST form | a router action: `const save = action(createTodo, "create-todo")` + `<form action={save} method="post">` over a `(form: FormData)` server function (other signatures are TS2322) — `.url` on a bare `"use server"` function is TS2339; it is typed only on `GET()` / `live()` references (GET search forms) |
| `<form method="get" action={update.url}>` for a mutation | GET forms only for idempotent search; mutations are POST |
| `window.location.href = ...` / `history.pushState` | `useNavigate()` or `<a href={Router.paths...}>` |
| `class={{ active: location.pathname === "/about" }}` hand-rolled link state | CSS on automatic `aria-current` / `data-active` / `data-pending`; `useLinkState` in JSX, `useIsRouting()` for progress bars |
| `new URLSearchParams(location.search)` hand-rolled query parsing | `useSearchParams()` (setter merges, no scroll); typed via a route `search` schema + `useSearchParams(Router.paths.search)` |
| `Router.paths.about()` / string-concatenated URLs | static nodes are properties (`Router.paths.about`); calls bind params, then search object and hash |
| `httpStatus(404)` in a click handler | call it bare in the component / error-fallback body (a scope declaration, not a mutation) |
| `try { user() } catch (e) { /* NotReadyError */ }` | `<Loading>` — app code should not catch `NotReadyError` |
| `{latest(() => results())}` as the visible list | settled read + `isPending()` for the indicator; `latest` is for previews |
| `selectedId={latest(selectedId)}` as the default highlight | `selectedId={selectedId()}` so highlight and content stay consistent; `latest` only when the highlight should move first |
| `isPending` on a root/global pending signal, or wrapping the whole shell | ask the question at the design site (dimmed list, disabled button, pane). It works on the source, a derived prop, or the write |
| `<Loading>` glued to the `createMemo` (consume + block in one place) | fetch high, block low — the boundary wraps the read, not the creation |
| `class={{ pending: isPending(id) }}` flashing on every navigation | same class + a short CSS `transition-delay` so only slow swaps show |
| `<Comments />` nested under `{story().title}` assumed to waterfall | both mount immediately and fetch in parallel if the child reads an already-known id; a real waterfall is `createMemo(() => fetchAuthor(story().authorId))` or `storyId={props.story.id}` |
| `<Errored>` as a terminal ErrorBoundary; `reset={() => location.reload()}` | the boundary heals when the source succeeds again; `reset` retries collected *sources*, not a UI remount |
| `<Errored>` around a list expected to catch a toggle/save failure | an error thrown out of an `action` never reaches `<Errored>` — it reverts the overlay and rejects the call's promise. Catch expected failures in the `action` (row errors in a map the projection folds in, which survives overlay discard; otherwise a toast) and `.catch` the call in the handler |
| `yield { ...tick, connected: true }` from `live()` | yield the value; wire status is `source.onstatus` (`"connected"` / `"reconnecting"` / `"closed"`) |
| sibling `<Loading>` fallbacks stacking as popcorn | `<Reveal collapsed>` (sequential default) suppresses tail skeletons past the frontier |
| in-memory cache around a GET server function | `return respond(value, { headers: { "cache-control": "..." } })` — metadata rides HTTP, the value rides the graph |
| `story()?.title` / treating `story()` as `Story \| undefined` | `{story().title}` under `<Loading>` — if the computation is running, the value is there |
| `typeof window !== "undefined"` | `isServer` / `isDev` from `@solidjs/web` |
| `Object.assign({}, props)` / expecting `merge` to skip `undefined` like 1.x `mergeProps` | `omit` / `merge` — explicit `undefined` **overrides** (Object.assign) |
| `isPending(user())` / `latest(user())` | `isPending(user)` / `latest(user)` — pass the accessor (or `() => user()`). Calling it first evaluates the read before the helper runs |
| `isPending(...)` as the first-load spinner | `<Loading>` owns first flight; `isPending` is the *refetch* indicator after a settled answer exists |
| a held write with no feedback anywhere | pair it with `isPending()` / `latest()` / an optimistic value / `affects()` — otherwise dev + attribution reports `[SILENT_HOLD]` |
| `refresh(getUser.key)` / `revalidate(user)` / `return refresh()` from `"use server"` | three APIs: core `refresh(source)` reruns a reactive source; router `revalidate(getUser.key)` invalidates the query cache; `return reload({ revalidate: "todos" })` asks the integration to refresh cached data |
| `return redirect(...)` as the only redirect shape | guards `throw redirect("/sign-in")`; `redirect()` / `respond()` take `revalidate` too when the mutation also moves or returns a value |
| `throw redirect("/sign-in")` / `return reload(...)` in a function called directly (core `action`, handler, plain memo) | only Solid Router `action` / `query` (and no-JS form posts) apply them — a direct caller resolves to the raw `Response` (or `null` when the router's single-flight hook intercepts a POST call), typed as your data. Without the router: `throw respond(null, { status: 401 })` or return a value and navigate in the caller |
| `submission.clear()` from an effect | on dismiss/resubmit only — from an effect, errors flash and vanish |
| `revalidate(liveSource)` | `live()` updates through the open stream; do not revalidate it |
| `refresh(user)` without `affects` when the reload should look pending | pair `affects(user)` with `refresh(user)` — a bare `refresh` re-asks quietly |
| `<Dynamic component={tab() ? A : B} />` | `const View = dynamic(() => (tab() ? A : B))` — `<Dynamic>` is deprecated (rc.9); `dynamic()` hoists the factory and keeps identity stable <!-- upstream:dynamic-deprecated --> |
| `setStore(async (draft) => { draft.x = await load(); })` | `const x = await load(); setStore((draft) => { draft.x = x; })` — the setter is a synchronous transaction; dev throws `[ASYNC_STORE_SETTER]` <!-- upstream:async-store-setter-throws --> |
| `setStore((d) => { d.items = seed; })` in a component body | seed through `createStore(seed)` / `createStore(() => props.items, fallback)` — a body-level store write is `[REACTIVE_WRITE_IN_OWNED_SCOPE]` <!-- upstream:store-write-owned-scope --> |
| `const saved = await api.save(); yield until(() => ...)` | `await api.save(); yield; yield until(() => ...)` — a bare `yield` re-enters the transaction before any reader is created, not only before writes |
| `fallback={(err) => { captureException(err()); return <Fallback />; }}` | `configureClientErrors({ onError })` from `solid-js` (or per root `render(fn, root, undefined, { onError })`), `configureServerErrors({ onError })` from `@solidjs/web` — once per error, with `ownerPath` / `boundaryPath` |
| `latest(user) ?? placeholder` in a handler as a null-safe read | `latest()` throws `NotReadyError` before the first value in every scope; read settled values under `<Loading>`, or `await until(() => user())` <!-- upstream:latest-throws-unsettled --> |
| `attribution.why(total)` / `attribution.format(e)` / `attribution.costs()` | named imports from `solid-js/attribution`: `why(total)`, `formatRerun(e)`, `costs()`, `feedback()`, `subscriptions(scope)` (rc.9) <!-- upstream:attribution-named-exports --> |
| `attribution.enable()` unguarded in app code, or `enable()` with the default `log: true` left on | `if (isDev) attribution.enable({ log: false })` — on the observe build an unguarded `enable()` records in production; prefer the `/__solid/diagnostics` session (`begin` enables, `end` disables) so app code carries nothing |
| `solid({ observe: true })` added "to see diagnostics in dev" | `vite dev` is always the dev build; `observe: true` is the production-observability opt-in (observe condition + `componentNames` for `vite build`/preview) |
| `configureServerErrors({ onError: (e) => { report(e); return e; } })` | return nothing or a reference (`new Error(\`ref ${id}\`)`) — the return value replaces the sanitized wire value; the error itself leaks message/stack/secrets |
| `import "./instrument"` at the top of the server entry for a monitoring SDK | `start: { instrument: "./src/instrument.ts" }` — ESM hoists static imports in dependency order, so the entry's own deps load first |
| Express/middleware injecting `traceparent` / trace headers into responses | the runtime carries a sampled or provided trace on `Server-Timing` + `<meta>`; forward downstream with `getTraceContext()?.entries`; SDKs use `OBSERVE?.server.trace.provide` |
| `OBSERVE.records.subscribe("call", (e) => setStats(...))` | listeners run synchronously inside the runtime and must not write signals; collect into a plain buffer and drain from outside |
| `import { storePath } from "solid-js"` | gone from `solid-js` (rc.9); write draft setters `setState((d) => { d.user.name = "Grace"; })` <!-- upstream:store-path-removed --> |
| `<meta name="description" content="...">` hardcoded in the document shell | `<Meta>` from `@solidjs/meta`. A static `<title>` is the fallback; other hardcoded tags coexist with the registry |
| `useHead({ tag: "meta", ... })` for ordinary page tags | `<Title>` / `<Meta>` / `<Script>` (JSON-LD). `useHead` is the lower-level registry |
| two `<Meta property="og:image">` meant as one replacement set | wrap them in `<Head>` — a later group replaces the earlier set as one unit |
| `createRoot(() => ...)` inside a component | let `render` / the component owner own the scope. `createRoot` is for tests, libraries, and non-render entry points |
| `JSON.stringify(store)` / `structuredClone(store)` | `snapshot(store)` — proxies throw or leak reactivity |
| `import { env } from "virtual:env/client"` (or `import.meta.env`) for a signing secret | `import { env } from "virtual:env/server"` — client map values are public |
| `renderToStream(...).pipe(res)` and also `.readable` / `await` on the same result | exactly one consumer: `pipe` / `pipeTo` / `readable` / await |
| `return Response.json(user, { status: 201 })` from `"use server"` | `return respond(user, { status: 201 })` — scripted callers receive `user`, not a `Response` |
| `<Portal>{user().name}</Portal>` for an async read | hoist the read above the portal (children start on the client); async UI inside one wants its own `<Loading>` |
| a client history adapter to pick the SSR location | `<Router url={request.url}>` (or the request event). Client adapters do not select the server URL |
| `fetch('/api')` at component-body top level | `createMemo(async () => { ... fetch ... })` under `<Loading>` — a top-level fetch runs once at mount and is not a reactive source |
| `<input type="checkbox" value={on()} />` | `checked={on()}` for the toggle; `value="string"` only when grouping radios or listing submitted values |
| `createMemo(() => { void save(); return x(); })` / an effect that calls an action | invoke actions from handlers, not from memos or effects |
| `createSignal(props.value)` / `createStore(props.items)` | `createSignal(() => props.value)` / `createStore(() => props.items, fallback)` — a bare `props.x` at setup is a snapshot. That form resets on every prop change; an intentional one-time read (an `initialCount` prop) is `createSignal(untrack(() => props.initialCount))` |
| `createRenderEffect` / `createTrackedEffect` as the default effect | two-phase `createEffect(compute, apply)`; `createTrackedEffect` is `@deprecated` (rc.9) <!-- upstream:tracked-effect-deprecated --> |
| `createEffect(() => source(), () => setError(null))` to reset a signal | `createSignal(() => { source(); return null; })` — the writable derivation resets on change; a sole-setter apply is rule 4 |
| a "server-safe" initial value adopted after mount (React hydration-mismatch fix) | client mode mounts with `render()` into an empty body — no hydration, no mismatch; read `localStorage` / `matchMedia` directly at signal creation |
| rewrite `App.tsx` with loading/error branches, or snapshot/restore, when the list moves to the server | same `setTodos`; wrap mutations in `action`; swap in function-form `createOptimisticStore(() => api.list(), [])` + a server-functions file. The overlay is discarded; the confirmed store is the truth |
| `createOptimisticStore<Todo[]>([])` holding the list, saved rows written after `yield` | `createOptimisticStore(() => api.list(), [])` + `refresh(todos)` (or a function form over a separate `createStore`) — the value form is a pure overlay: action writes vanish on settle <!-- upstream:optimistic-value-overlay --> |
| disable an optimistic row until ack, or mutex rapid clicks / freeze unrelated writes | keep the control enabled; `action` is the transaction. An in-flight action does not freeze other writes. Failed-action replay is optional |
| tRPC / RPC type-gen around `"use server"` | TypeScript does not cross HTTP — validate inside the function. Locals only the body reads (db, secrets) stay off the client |
| `src/routes/api/todos.ts` (or a Next `route.ts`) wrapping `db.todos.insert` | `"use server"` *is* the RPC. API routes are for real HTTP endpoints (webhooks), not the app's own mutations |
| router/server mutation, then `fetch` / `onSettled` / `hydrate` to refresh the page | `reload` / `revalidate` / single-flight (the mutation response can seed destination preloads). In-flight Promises serialize as Promises; `live()` continues from HTML |
| delay `renderToStream` so HTML arrives in visual order | stream as soon as ready; `<Reveal collapsed>` controls when content *appears* |
| subscribe/unsubscribe in the component around `live()` | `createMemo(() => stockPrice(props.symbol))` — hoist that memo to share one connection. `onstatus` is on the iterable the `live()` call returns, not on the memo. Until the first yield, `<Loading>`; later yields are updates |
| a Solid adapter / custom Worker / Express bridge, or `entry-client.tsx` under `start: true` | With a server bundle: `handleRequest` from `dist/server/server.js` / Fetchable `fetch`; platform plugins adopt it. Node: `start: { node: true }` → `node dist/server/node.js` (its `listener` for an existing Express / Fastify app). Client-only start: static `dist/client`. Middleware is `start: { middleware: "..." }`, not Express `app.use` |
| `createMemo(async () => (await props.story).author)` | `createMemo(() => props.story.author)` — a derivation over an async value becomes async; no await, no Promise type |
| return a component from `"use server"` / flip `serverFunctions.components` | experimental preview — do not enable unless the project already has that flag |

```tsx
// WRONG — post-await read never subscribes; production can hang pending
const user = createMemo(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/me');
  const extra = flag(); // too late
  return { ...(await response.json()), extra };
});

// CORRECT
const user = createMemo(async () => {
  const extra = flag();
  const response = await fetch('/api/me');
  return { ...(await response.json()), extra };
});
```

```tsx
// WRONG — rest is a plain object snapshot
function Field(props: { label: string; class?: string }) {
  const rest = { ...props };
  return <label>{props.label}<input {...rest} /></label>;
}

// CORRECT
function Field(props: { label: string; class?: string }) {
  const rest = omit(props, 'label');
  return <label>{props.label}<input {...rest} /></label>;
}
```

```tsx
// WRONG — extracting at the parent is a real read; child's <Loading> never sees it
function Page() {
  const user = createMemo(async () => (await fetch('/api/me')).json());
  const current = user();
  return <Profile user={current} />;
}

// CORRECT — JSX props are lazy (passing isn't reading); types stay User
function Profile(props: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <Loading fallback={<p>Loading…</p>}>
      <h1>{props.user.name}</h1>
    </Loading>
  );
}
function Page() {
  const user = createMemo(async () => (await fetch('/api/me')).json());

```tsx
// WRONG — two different `action`s; the core one is not a form URL
import { action } from 'solid-js';
const save = action(async function* (form: FormData) {
  yield persist(form);
});
<form onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); void save(new FormData(e.currentTarget)); }}>
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>

// CORRECT — router action is POST-addressable (only if `@solidjs/router` is in the project)
import { action } from '@solidjs/router';
const save = action(async (form: FormData) => persist(form), 'save');
<form action={save} method="post">
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>

```tsx
// WRONG — evaluating JSX before the root exists
import { render } from '@solidjs/web';
render(<App />, document.getElementById('app')!);

// CORRECT
render(() => <App />, document.getElementById('app')!);
```

```tsx
// WRONG — user() runs before isPending, so the helper never sees the accessor
<article aria-busy={isPending(user())}>{user().name}</article>

// CORRECT — pass the accessor (or () => user()); <Loading> still owns first flight
<Loading fallback={<p>Loading…</p>}>
  <article aria-busy={isPending(user) ? 'true' : 'false'}>{user().name}</article>
</Loading>
```

```tsx
// WRONG — tab() is read once at setup; View never changes
const View = tab() ? Detailed : Compact;
return <View value="now" />;

// CORRECT
const View = dynamic(() => (tab() ? Detailed : Compact));
return <View value="now" />;

## Review checklist (before finishing any TSX change)

- [ ] No props destructuring; no `props.` at component-body top level.
- [ ] Every reactive read (`signal()`, `props.x`, `store.x`) sits in JSX, a memo, an effect
      compute, or a boundary — not the component body.
- [ ] No signal-synced-by-effect; derived values are functions or memos. Reset-on-change
      is a writable derivation (`createSignal(() => { source(); return initial; })`), not
      an effect calling the setter.
- [ ] Event handlers wrap setters (`onClick={() => setX(...)}`), use `currentTarget`,
      and `onInput` for keystrokes. Debounce at the handler, never as an effect copying
      signals. `innerHTML` is sanitized and not mixed with children.
- [ ] Async memos are passed as values (`user={user()}`); JSX props are lazy.
      Types stay `User` — not `Promise<User>` / `Accessor<User>`. `<Loading>` wraps
      the *read*, not the memo, not chrome. Extracting `const u = user()` at the
      parent is the read that throws. Nested child fetches run in parallel
      (components do not suspend); a real waterfall is `fetchB(a().id)`.
      `isPending` is per-expression (`isPending(() => props.story)` works);
      `latest(selectedId)` is opt-in, not the default highlight. Inputs feeding a request
      bind `latest(query)`; failures throw to `<Errored>`, never `{ success: false }`
      result objects checked at every read.
- [ ] Lists via `<For>` (server/refetched rows keyed by stable id), conditionals via
      ternary/`<Show>`; no `{list().map(...)}` in JSX; no `key` props (except
      `@solidjs/meta` tags); no `value()!`.
- [ ] Effects are two-phase and only at imperative boundaries; apply does not read stores.
- [ ] Async reads sit under `<Loading>` (the data slot, not chrome); errors under `<Errored>`.
      Reactive inputs of an async memo are read before the first `await`. No hand-rolled
      `loading`/`error` signals or `=== undefined` readiness branches. First load is
      `<Loading>`; refetch indicator is `isPending(user)` (the accessor, not `user()`)
      or `isPending(selectedId)` when the write is the question. `<Errored>` heals
      when the source succeeds; `reset` retries sources, not a UI remount. Mutation
      failures never reach `<Errored>` (an escaping error reverts the overlay and
      rejects the call): catch them in the action/projection, and `.catch` the call
      in the handler. Error monitoring goes through `configureClientErrors` /
      `configureServerErrors` (or `render(fn, root, undefined, { onError })`), never a side effect in
      the fallback. Core `refresh(source)`, router `revalidate(key)`, and `return reload(...)` are
      different APIs — do not mix them. Client → server is additive (same
      setters + `action` + server functions): do not rewrite App with
      loading/error branches, disable optimistic rows until ack, or refetch in
      `hydrate` / `onSettled`. HTTP does not enforce TypeScript — validate
      inside `"use server"`; do not invent tRPC. `live()` owns the client connection,
      is declared `live(GET(fn))`, and a mutation on a live-read value holds with
      `yield until(...)` for the echo instead of `refresh()`.
      A server bundle uses `handleRequest` from `dist/server/server.js`; client-only start
      is static `dist/client`. Do not delay `renderToStream` for visual order
      (`<Reveal>` does).
- [ ] External collections reconcile into stores (function-form `createStore` /
      `reconcile`), never wholesale draft assignment of a fresh tree
      (`setTodos((t) => t.filter(...))` for removal is fine — survivors keep identity).
- [ ] Rest props via `omit`, not `{ ...props }`. Conditional `class` via objects, not string concat.
- [ ] Input filters write back to the DOM on reject (inputs do not rewind).
- [ ] No Solid 1.x imports or APIs (`solid-js/store`, `createResource`, `onMount`, `Suspense`, ...).
      No `JSX` imported from `solid-js` — markup types are `JSX.Element` from
      `@solidjs/web` or `Element` from `solid-js` (aliased next to DOM code).
- [ ] Inspect children with `children()`; code-split with `lazy` + `<Loading>`; reactive
      component choice with `dynamic()`. No `React.lazy`, no effects inside ref callbacks.
- [ ] Browser-only code uses `isServer` / `clientOnly` (components) / `ssrSource`
      (values), not `typeof window`.
      Component teardown is `onSettled` (return cleanup), not `onCleanup`; nothing
      inside the `onSettled` callback calls `onCleanup`, `flush()`, or creates a
      memo/effect. Effect `apply` functions have block bodies and return only a
      cleanup or nothing.
- [ ] Dev console shows no diagnostics: reads in tracking scopes (no
      `[STRICT_READ_UNTRACKED]`), store setters synchronous and never called at
      body level (no `[ASYNC_STORE_SETTER]` <!-- upstream:async-store-setter-throws --> /
      `[REACTIVE_WRITE_IN_OWNED_SCOPE]` <!-- upstream:store-write-owned-scope -->), held
      writes paired with `isPending` / `latest` / optimistic values / `affects()`
      (no `[SILENT_HOLD]`). Attribution-only costs
      (`[IMMUTABLE_UPDATE_IN_STORE]`, `[UNSTABLE_LIST_IDENTITY]`, `[EFFECT_*]`)
      checked via the [development loop](#development-loop-self-diagnose-before-finishing)
      (`/__solid/diagnostics` `begin` → interact → `whyDidRun` / `costs` → `end`, or an
      `isDev`-guarded `attribution.enable({ log: false })` + `why` / `costs` /
      `feedback`) whenever the change touched stores, lists, async, actions, or
      effects. Name interrogated scopes (`{ name: "total" }`). `observe: true` is a
      production opt-in, not a dev step.
- [ ] If the project has a router: `createRouter({ routes })`, not JSX `<Route>` / `<A>`.
      One instance, no nested `<Router>`. Navigate with `useNavigate` / `<a href>`, not
      `window.location`. Router `action`/`query` come from `@solidjs/router` (POST forms + cache), not
      core `action`/`refresh`. Forms: `<form action={save} method="post">`. Core `action`
      bodies are generators (`function*` / `async function*`) suspending on `yield`,
      never plain `async` functions. Link state is automatic attributes + CSS
      (`aria-current` / `data-active` / `data-pending`; `useLinkState` / `useIsRouting`
      in JSX). Search params via `useSearchParams`. Forms validate on the server
      (`throw respond({ issues }, { status: 400 })`) with inline errors from
      `useSubmissions`.
- [ ] `render(() => <App />, root)` — a function, not `render(<App />)`. `hydrate` when
      HTML already exists. Stream async/lazy trees (`await renderToStream(...)`) with
      exactly one consumer (`pipe` / `pipeTo` / `readable`). Snapshot stores with
      `snapshot(store)`, not `JSON.stringify`. Secrets live in `virtual:env/server`.
- [ ] `jsxImportSource` is `@solidjs/web`; Vite plugin is `@solidjs/vite-plugin`.
      No `@solidjs/start`, `vinxi`, `"use client"`, or Next.js imports.
- [ ] Single return per component; no early returns on reactive conditions.
- [ ] `solid2-kit check` and the project's typecheck pass; `solid2-kit doctor` too if
      `package.json`, tsconfig, or root config files changed.
