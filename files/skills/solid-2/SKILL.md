# Writing Solid 2.0

This project uses Solid 2.0 (`solid-js` 2.x) with `@solidjs/web`. The hard rules are
installed by solid2-agent-kit as an always-applied rules file (`.cursor/rules/solid-2.mdc`
for Cursor; a managed block in `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code). This skill adds the mental
model, decision tables, and canonical patterns. When an API is in doubt, verify against the
official docs — see [Checking the official docs](#checking-the-official-docs).

## The one difference everything follows from

React re-runs component functions to compute the next UI. **Solid runs a component function
once, at mount.** After that, signals and stores notify only the computations and JSX
expressions that read them. There is no re-render, no reconciliation of component output,
no snapshot props, no stale closures, no dependency arrays.

Practical consequences:

- Values must travel as **accessors (functions)**, not as extracted values. Extracting a
  value at component-body top level freezes it forever.
- The component body is **untracked**. Tracking scopes are: JSX expressions, `createMemo`
  compute, `createEffect` compute (first argument), and boundary children.
- Event handlers run untracked: they always read current values and never subscribe.
- Object identity is stable: handlers, context values, and props objects are created once.
  `useCallback` / `useMemo`-for-identity / `React.memo` have no purpose here.

## Decision tables

### Where does state live?

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Scalar local state (count, open/closed, text input) | `createSignal(value)` in the component |
| Object/array state where parts update independently (forms, lists, nested data) | `createStore(value)` — property-level subscriptions |
| Object that is replaced wholesale (fetch response, selected item, `User \| null`) | `createSignal(objectValue)` |
| Value derived from other reactive values | plain function `() => ...` (never a signal synced by an effect) |
| Expensive derivation, multiple consumers, or equality boundary needed | `createMemo(() => ...)` |
| Follows a prop but user can locally override; prop change resets | writable derivation: `createSignal(() => props.value)` / `createStore(() => props.value, fallback)` |
| Shared by a subtree, independent per provider instance | signal/store created inside a provider component, passed via context |
| Truly app-wide singleton (theme, session, locale) | module-level signal/store (beware SSR: module state is shared across requests) |
| Tentative value during a mutation | `createOptimistic` / `createOptimisticStore` + `action` |
| Values pushed by an external subscription (websocket, reactive client) | async iterable returned from a memo (or function-form `createStore` for keyed reconciliation) — never `{ data, error }` signal pairs |

### Should this be an effect?

Most React `useEffect` code should NOT become `createEffect`:

| React habit | Solid 2 |
|---|---|
| Compute a rendered value in an effect | plain function or `createMemo` |
| Fetch data in an effect, copy into state | `createMemo(async () => ...)` + `<Loading>` |
| React to a user interaction | do the work in the event handler or an `action` |
| Sync one state into another | delete the second state; derive it |
| Push a settled reactive value into a non-Solid system (DOM API, third-party widget, analytics, subscription) | `createEffect(compute, apply)` — this is the only real use |
| One-time setup after mount (`onMount`) | `onSettled(() => { ...; return cleanup })` |
| Measure DOM / observe size after paint | ref **directive factory** + `onSettled` (writes a *new* input; not an effect that copies state) |

### Composition, code-splitting, SSR

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Wrapper that only renders its children | `{props.children}` — no helper |
| Inspect, count, or iterate children | `children(() => props.children)` then `.toArray()` |
| Code-split a component | `lazy(() => import("./X"))` read under `<Loading>` |
| Named export from a lazy module | `lazy(() => import("./pages"), { export: "About" })` |
| Pick a component/tag from reactive state | `dynamic(() => ...)` from `@solidjs/web` (stable identity) |
| Browser-only widget (charts, maps, `window`) | `clientOnly(() => import("./Chart"))` from `@solidjs/web` (`{ lazy: true }` defers the import until first render) |
| Server vs browser branch | `isServer` / `isDev` from `@solidjs/web` (build-time constants), not `typeof window` |
| SSR-stable `id` / `for` / `aria-*` pairing | `createUniqueId()` |

## Canonical patterns

### Component with local state and derived value

```tsx
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  const doubled = () => count() * 2; // derivation: a function, not a memo, not an effect

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>
      {count()} x 2 = {doubled()}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Props: read late, never destructure

```tsx
// CORRECT — reads happen inside JSX (a tracking scope)
function Greeting(props: { name: string; punctuation?: string }) {
  return <p>Hello, {props.name}{props.punctuation ?? '.'}</p>;
}

// WRONG — reads the getter once at setup; never updates again
function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) { /* ... */ }
```

To give a derived prop a local name, name the *function* (or `createMemo` if expensive):

```tsx
const full = () => `${props.first} ${props.last}`;
```

To merge defaults or split props reactively use `merge` / `omit` from `solid-js`
(replacements for Solid 1.x `mergeProps` / `splitProps`). `merge` is like
`Object.assign`: an explicit `undefined` **overrides** the previous source.
Omitted keys still fall through, so `merge({ type: "button" }, props)` is the
usual defaults pattern. That is not Solid 1 `mergeProps`, which ignored
`undefined`. Forwarding leftover props: `const rest = omit(props, "label")` then
`<input {...rest} />`. `const rest = { ...props }` compiles and then never updates.

### Store updates (draft mutation)

```tsx
import { createStore } from 'solid-js';

const [profile, setProfile] = createStore({ name: 'Ada', role: 'Engineer' });

setProfile((draft) => {
  draft.name = 'Grace'; // only readers of .name re-run
});
```

**External collections enter stores through reconciliation, never wholesale assignment.**
`draft.todos = serverTodos` renders correctly but replaces every object identity — all
subscribers under the path re-run and row identity is lost. In order of preference:

1. Function-form `createStore(() => source, fallback)` or `createProjection` — reconcile
   automatically (keyed by `"id"`), surviving items keep proxy identity.
2. Manual merge: `setTodos(reconcile(fresh, 'id'))`, or on a nested slot
   `setState((draft) => { reconcile(fresh, 'id')(draft.todos); })`. Positional data
   (fixed-shape dashboards): `reconcile(next, null)`.

Plain non-reactive copy for logging/serialization/`structuredClone`: `snapshot(store)`.
Subscribe an effect compute to every nested change: `deep(store)`.

### Children: pass through, or resolve with `children()`

Most wrappers just render `props.children`. Use the `children` helper only when
the component must **inspect or iterate** them. It returns an accessor with
`.toArray()`. The helper call belongs in the component body; the read of
`props.children` is inside the accessor (a tracking scope), so this is not a
setup-time snapshot. Do not assign `const kids = props.children` and do not
treat resolved children as a reactive data list for `<For>`:

```tsx
import { children, type ParentProps } from 'solid-js';

function Stack(props: ParentProps) {
  const resolved = children(() => props.children);
  return <div class="stack">{resolved.toArray()}</div>;
}
```

### Code-splitting: `lazy` + `<Loading>`

```tsx
import { lazy, Loading } from 'solid-js';

const Profile = lazy(() => import('./Profile'));
const About = lazy(() => import('./pages'), { export: 'About' });

<Loading fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <Profile id="42" />
</Loading>

<button type="button" onMouseEnter={() => Profile.preload()}>Open profile</button>
```

Never `React.lazy` / `<Suspense>`. The lazy component suspends through
`<Loading>` on first render; `.preload()` starts the import early. Named
exports must use `{ export: "About" }` — a `.then((m) => ({ default: m.About }))`
wrapper hydrates incorrectly (the name is not a call-site literal).

### Dynamic component: `dynamic()` (canonical)

```tsx
import { createSignal, type Component } from 'solid-js';
import { dynamic } from '@solidjs/web';

const Compact: Component<{ value: string }> = (props) => <span>{props.value}</span>;
const Detailed: Component<{ value: string }> = (props) => <strong>{props.value}</strong>;

const [detailed, setDetailed] = createSignal(false);
const Result = dynamic(() => (detailed() ? Detailed : Compact));

<Result value="Current result" />
```

`dynamic()` returns a **stable** component whose source can be a component, an
intrinsic tag name, a promise, or empty. Prefer it over swapping a component
variable in JSX. `<Dynamic>` is the JSX spelling of the same primitive.

### Two-phase effect (imperative boundary only)

```tsx
import { createEffect } from 'solid-js';

createEffect(
  () => props.roomId,          // compute: ALL reactive reads here; return value feeds apply
  (roomId) => {                // apply: untracked imperative work
    const connection = chat.connect(roomId);
    return () => connection.close(); // cleanup before next run / on disposal
  },
);
```

Reads inside `apply` do not track. Extract every needed reactive value in `compute`
(e.g. `() => ({ name: user.name, role: user.role })`). Passing a store proxy into `apply`
and reading `user.name` there *runs once* and never retriggers. Compute-phase errors can be
intercepted with the bundle form `createEffect(compute, { effect, error })`.

### Async data

```tsx
import { Errored, For, Loading, createMemo, createSignal } from 'solid-js';

const [query, setQuery] = createSignal('');
const results = createMemo(async () => {
  const value = query().trim();
  if (!value) return [];
  return api.search(value);
});

return (
  <Errored fallback={(error) => <p>{String(error())}</p>}>
    <Loading fallback={<p>Searching...</p>}>
      <ul><For each={results()}>{(r) => <li>{r.title}</li>}</For></ul>
    </Loading>
  </Errored>
);
```

- The `<Loading>` boundary must be an owner ancestor of the **read** (`results()`), not of
  where the memo was created, and not of page chrome (header/nav) that should stay mounted.
  Boundary placement is purely a UX decision — it does not change when fetches start
  (no waterfalls: nested components set up and fetch in parallel). After first paint the
  boundary keeps settled content during refetch; `isPending(() => results())` is the
  indicator. Use `on={query()}` (the **value**, not the accessor `on={query}`) only when
  that identity should put the fallback back on screen.
- Read every reactive input **before the first `await`** in an async computation. A read
  after `await` does not subscribe; production can sit pending with no retry.
- `<Errored>` function fallbacks receive an error **accessor** and a `reset` callback:
  `fallback={(error, reset) => ...}`.
- Refetch: `refresh(results)`. In-flight indicator: `isPending(() => results())`.
  Freshest in-flight value for imperative code: `latest(results)`.
- Coordinate reveal order of sibling `<Loading>` boundaries with `<Reveal order="sequential" | "together" | "natural">`.

**Never hand-roll these states.** No `[loading, setLoading]` signal, no
`data() === undefined` branch, no `{ data, error }` signal pair — those are React/Solid 1.x
reflexes that bypass the async model and `solid2-kit check` flags them. If a value is async,
make it an async computation and read it under boundaries. Refetching is `refresh(source)`
(typically as the last step of a mutation `action`, or a reload button) — never a
counter/version signal read inside the computation to force re-runs; input-driven refetch is
already automatic.

**Normalize thrown values once.** Thrown values are `unknown` in JavaScript, so define one
shared `ErrorFallback` component per app — extract the message via `instanceof Error`, wire
`reset` to a Retry affordance — and pass it to every `<Errored fallback>`, instead of
repeating `String(error())` at each boundary:

```tsx
<Errored fallback={(error, reset) => <ErrorFallback error={error} reset={reset} />}>
```

### Streams and subscriptions (websockets, reactive clients)

Push-based sources integrate by returning an **async iterable** from a computation — reads
then suspend to `<Loading>` until the first value, later pushes update the settled value,
and thrown errors reach `<Errored>`. Integration layers should return a plain accessor, not
`{ data, error }` signals:

```tsx
import { createMemo, onCleanup } from 'solid-js';

function createSubscriptionQuery<T>(
  subscribe: (next: (value: T) => void, fail: (error: unknown) => void) => () => void,
) {
  const queue: T[] = [];
  let failure: unknown;
  let wake = () => {};
  // Component-owned setup: unsubscribe is tied to the caller's owner.
  onCleanup(subscribe(
    (value) => { queue.push(value); wake(); },
    (error) => { failure = error; wake(); },
  ));

  return createMemo(() => (async function* () {
    while (true) {
      if (failure !== undefined) throw failure;
      if (queue.length > 0) { yield queue.shift() as T; continue; }
      await new Promise<void>((resolve) => { wake = resolve; });
    }
  })());
}
```

### Mutations: `action` + optimistic state

```tsx
import { action, createOptimisticStore, refresh } from 'solid-js';

const [todos, setTodos] = createOptimisticStore(fetchTodos, []);

const addTodo = action(function* (todo: Todo) {
  setTodos((draft) => { draft.push(todo); }); // optimistic, auto-reverts on failure
  yield saveTodo(todo);                        // yield promises to stay in the transaction
  refresh(todos);
});
// invoke from an event handler: onClick={() => void addTodo(newTodo)}
```

Ordinary signal/store writes inside an action are held until it settles. Never call
`flush()` inside an action. Invoke actions from handlers, not from component/computation bodies.

**`yield`, not a bare `await`, is the transaction boundary.** `await api.save()` then
`setTodos(...)` *runs*, but the write commits immediately and optimistic rollback is lost.
Either `yield saveTodo(todo)` or, when you need a typed result, `const saved = await api.save(); yield; setTodos(...)`.

Navigation-shaped updates do **not** need core `action`. A plain setter is enough:
reads pull the async, and downstream async computeds hold previous values until the
new ones are ready (`isPending` / `latest`). Reach for `action` from `solid-js` only
when writes happen *after* async work. Router form `action` from `@solidjs/router` is
a different API (URL + POST) — see [App stack](#app-stack-only-if-the-project-has-these-packages).

### Lists: `<For>` child signatures per keying mode

```tsx
// Default (keyed by item reference): item is the RAW value, index is an accessor
<For each={todos()}>{(todo, index) => <Row todo={todo} n={index()} />}</For>

// Key function: BOTH are accessors
<For each={todos()} keyed={(todo) => todo.id}>{(todo) => <Row todo={todo()} />}</For>

// Positional (Solid 1.x <Index>): item is an accessor, index is a plain number
<For each={cells()} keyed={false}>{(cell, i) => <Cell value={cell()} at={i} />}</For>
```

Choosing the keying mode:

| Where the rows come from | Mode |
|---|---|
| Server/refetched data — fetch results, subscription payloads (fresh object references on every update) | **key function on a stable id** (`keyed={(item) => item.id}`) — reference keying would recreate every row on each update |
| Local array whose item identities are stable (e.g. store rows, static lists) | default (item reference) |
| Fixed positions where only contents change | `keyed={false}` |

Never `{todos().map((t) => <Row todo={t} />)}` and never `<For each={todos().map(...)}>`.
The `.map` form *renders*; it just rebuilds every row. `children().toArray().map` is
fine — those nodes are already resolved.

`<Repeat from={start()} count={20}>{(index) => ...}</Repeat>` renders by absolute index with
no array diffing — use for fixed slot counts and virtual scrolling windows.

### Conditionals

Ternaries work and are reactive, but **when the truthy branch reads the tested value, use
`<Show>`**: its function child receives a narrowed accessor, so no non-null assertion is
needed. Never write `value()!` to narrow by hand (`solid2-kit check` flags it):

```tsx
// WRONG — hand narrowing with a non-null assertion
{error() ? <p>{error()!.message}</p> : <TaskList />}

// CORRECT — Show narrows; fallback holds the other branch
<Show when={error()} fallback={<TaskList />}>
  {(err) => <p>{err().message}</p>}
</Show>
```

```tsx
<Show when={user()} fallback={<SignIn />}>
  {(currentUser) => <Profile user={currentUser()} />} {/* narrowed ACCESSOR */}
</Show>
```

Plain ternaries remain fine when no narrowing is involved (`{open() ? <A /> : <B />}`).

Default `Show` keeps children mounted across truthy changes. Add `keyed` to remount when the
value's identity changes (child then receives the raw value, like React's `key` reset).
Prefer the default; use `keyed` only when internal state must reset. Multi-branch:
`<Switch>` / `<Match>` — **first truthy `<Match>` wins**; later matches are skipped,
even if they are also truthy.

Components must **return once**: never early-return based on a reactive value — the branch
is picked at setup and frozen. Early returns on non-reactive values (build-time config, a
missing environment variable) are fine.

### Input filtering (inputs do not rewind)

React's controlled inputs force the DOM back to the state value on every re-render, so
"ignore invalid keystrokes" works by simply not updating state. Solid has no re-render:
`value={v()}` writes the DOM only when `v` changes, so rejected characters **stay visible**
unless you rewind the DOM yourself:

```tsx
<input
  value={v()}
  onInput={(event) => {
    if (/^\d*$/.test(event.currentTarget.value)) setV(event.currentTarget.value);
    else event.currentTarget.value = v(); // reject: explicit write-back
  }}
/>
```

### Context

```tsx
import { createContext, createSignal, useContext } from 'solid-js';
import type { Accessor, ParentProps, Setter } from 'solid-js';

type Theme = 'light' | 'dark';

const ThemeContext = createContext<{ theme: Accessor<Theme>; setTheme: Setter<Theme> }>();

function ThemeProvider(props: ParentProps) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = createSignal<Theme>('light');
  return <ThemeContext value={{ theme, setTheme }}>{props.children}</ThemeContext>;
}

function ThemeButton() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext); // destructuring here is FINE
  return <button onClick={() => setTheme('dark')}>{theme()}</button>;
}
```

Pass accessors/setters/stores through context — never `value={theme()}` (a dead snapshot).
No `useMemo` for the value object, no context splitting: the object is created once and
fine-grained updates flow through the signals inside it. Context is **subtree scoping**.
A true app-wide singleton (theme, session, locale) is a module-level signal/store —
do not invent a root provider for that. Module state is shared across SSR requests.

### Refs

```tsx
import { onSettled, type Ref } from 'solid-js';

function listen(type: string, handler: EventListener, options?: AddEventListenerOptions) {
  let element: HTMLElement | undefined;
  onSettled(() => {
    const target = element;
    if (!target) return;
    target.addEventListener(type, handler, options);
    return () => target.removeEventListener(type, handler, options);
  });
  return (next: HTMLElement) => { element = next; };
}

function SearchField(props: { ref?: Ref<HTMLInputElement>; onInput: EventListener }) {
  let input!: HTMLInputElement;
  return (
    <>
      <input
        ref={[props.ref, (el) => (input = el), listen('input', props.onInput, { passive: true })]}
        type="search"
      />
      <button type="button" onClick={() => input.select()}>Select</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Ref arrays flatten recursively; each callback runs in order. No `forwardRef` needed.

**Ref callbacks run untracked and without an owner.** Their return values are
ignored — do not create effects, memos, or `onCleanup` inside the callback, and
do not `return () => cleanup`. Put owned setup in a **directive factory** (like
`listen` above) and return only the element callback. Use this for
`ResizeObserver`, third-party widgets, and native listener options (`capture` /
`passive`) — Solid event props do not take those options.

## Scheduling and tests

Signal/store writes outside a synchronous flush scope are **staged**; the reactive queue
commits on the next microtask. Event handlers need nothing. Tests must flush:

```ts
setCount(2);
flush();
expect(count()).toBe(2);
```

Wait for an async expression to settle in tests: `await resolve(() => value())`.
`flush()` only drains staged **synchronous** writes — it is not a stand-in for waiting
on a pending resource. Run tests in dev mode first — Solid 2 emits diagnostics for top-level reactive reads,
writes from owned scopes, and async reads outside `<Loading>`. Fix them; don't suppress.

Component tests use `@solidjs/testing-library`. Pass a **function** to `render` so
the tree has an owner, and `flush()` after interactions that stage writes:

```tsx
import { cleanup, fireEvent, render } from '@solidjs/testing-library';
import { flush } from 'solid-js';
import { afterEach, expect, test } from 'vitest';

afterEach(cleanup);

test('increments on click', () => {
  const { getByRole } = render(() => <Counter />);
  const button = getByRole('button');
  fireEvent.click(button);
  flush();
  expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Clicks: 1');
});
```

`jsxImportSource` for tests and app code is `"@solidjs/web"`, not `"solid-js"`.
Vite plugin is `@solidjs/vite-plugin`, not `vite-plugin-solid`.

## App stack (only if the project has these packages)

This kit's always-applied rules cover `solid-js` + `@solidjs/web` TSX. Official
Solid 2 docs also describe optional app layers. **If those packages are in the
project, use them — do not invent Next.js, React Router, SolidStart 1.x, or
Solid Router 0.x/1.x stand-ins.** Patterns below; fetch the matching pages from
[references/official-docs.md](references/official-docs.md).

### Compiler / packages

```json
{ "compilerOptions": { "jsx": "preserve", "jsxImportSource": "@solidjs/web" } }
```

Import DOM `JSX` types from `@solidjs/web`; renderer-neutral `Component` /
`ParentProps` from `solid-js`. Vite: `import solid from "@solidjs/vite-plugin"`
with `start: true` / `ssr: true` / `serverFunctions: true` only when the
project already uses start mode. Tiers are `bare` → `basic` (router) →
`fullstack` (SSR + server functions); do not jump a tier without cause.

### Solid Router 2 — `createRouter`, not JSX `<Route>`

```tsx
import { lazy } from 'solid-js';
import { createRouter } from '@solidjs/router';

export const Router = createRouter({
  routes: [
    { path: '/', component: lazy(() => import('./pages/Home')) },
    { path: '/about', component: lazy(() => import('./pages/About')) },
    { path: '*404', component: lazy(() => import('./pages/NotFound')) },
  ],
});
export const { paths } = Router;

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      {(props) => (
        <>
          <a href={Router.paths()}>Home</a>
          <main>{props.children}</main>
        </>
      )}
    </Router>
  );
}
```

Create the instance at **module scope**. Nested layouts are `children` arrays
on the route objects, not nested `<Route>` / nested routers. Navigate with
plain `<a href={Router.paths.about}>` (or `useNavigate`); there is no `<A>` /
`<Navigate>` / `<HashRouter>` / `<FileRoutes />`. Session location is `useLocation` / `useParams`,
not `Router.paths`. A route `preload` result is `props.data` on the matched
component (and the factory `preload` result is the root render prop's `props.data`).
Link warming: `preload="false"` skips that link's *data* preload; `preloadLinks: false`
disables automatic link preloading. Intent values are `"initial"` / `"navigate"` /
`"native"` / `"preload"`. One router per app.

**Two different `action`s.** Core `action` from `solid-js` is a generator transaction
(optimistic writes that span an async gap). Router `action` from `@solidjs/router` is
a URL-addressable POST mutation (`useSubmissions`, `<form action={save} method="post">`).
Do not import one and use it as the other.

```tsx
import { action } from '@solidjs/router';
import { redirect } from '@solidjs/web';

const save = action(async (form: FormData) => {
  await saveProfile(form);
  return redirect('/account');
}, 'update-profile');

<form action={save} method="post">
  <input name="displayName" />
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

Only POST forms are accepted. Bind extra args with `.with(id)` (they go in the
action URL). `onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); fetch(...) }}` *runs* and
drops the no-JS form fallback. `useAction` is JS-only for the same reason.

**`query` is the read cache** (optional, only with the router). Wrap a read,
give it a stable name, and consume it through a Solid async primitive:

```tsx
import { createMemo } from 'solid-js';
import { query, revalidate } from '@solidjs/router';

export const getUser = query(async (id: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
  return response.json();
}, 'users');

const user = createMemo(() => getUser(params.id));
// after a mutation:
revalidate(getUser.key);
revalidate(getUser.keyFor('42'));
```

A bare `createMemo(async () => fetchUser(id()))` still works; it just has no
shared cache, no preload reuse, and no `revalidate`. Do not wrap mutations in
`query` — wrapping an undeclared server function makes it GET. `query.get(key)`
throws if there is no entry; `query.set` does not accept a promise. Cache is
request-scoped on the server and application-scoped in the browser. After a
router mutation, `revalidate(...)` — not core `refresh()`. Replace SolidStart /
Router 0.x leftovers: no `createAsync`, `useSubmission` (singular), `cache()`,
router `json()`, or `<FileRoutes />` (`fileRoutes(pageRoutes)` instead).

### Server functions — `"use server"`

```ts
export async function findUser(id: string) {
  'use server';
  // validate `id`; read identity from getRequestEvent(), never from arguments
  return database.users.find(id);
}
```

A function-level server function cannot close over component locals — pass
values as arguments. Treat every argument as untrusted. During SSR the same
reference runs in-process; in the browser it is HTTP. Mutations that should
revalidate: `redirect` / `reload` from `@solidjs/web` (see the server-function
guides). For 404 during SSR: `httpStatus(404)` from `@solidjs/web`.
`throw new Error("…")` is stripped to `"Internal Server Error"` in production —
use `markSafeError` or `respond(..., { status })` for intentional client-facing
failures. `GET()` is only for idempotent reads (URLs leak into logs/history);
import it from `@solidjs/web/server-functions`, never `@solidjs/start`.
`live()` yields **current state** (each yield replaces the last); do not treat
it as an append-only event log, and hoist the memo so consumers share one
connection.
Unscripted forms: `<form method="post" action={createTodo.url}>` (the reference
`.url`), not a client `preventDefault` + `fetch`.

### Document head — no MetaProvider

```tsx
import { Title, Link, Meta } from '@solidjs/meta';

<Title>Page title</Title>
<Meta name="description" content="..." />

Solid Meta 1.x has **no provider**. Render tags anywhere; later wins, unmount
restores. `useHead` from `@solidjs/web` is the lower-level registry. Do not
hardcode a second `<title>` in the document shell.

## These still run — write the other form

Official docs (and the compiler) allow several of these. They are the wrong
tool: they snapshot, drop subscriptions, or rebuild work Solid already knows
how to reuse. Prefer the form on the right.

| Compiles / renders | Write this |
|---|---|
| `{todos().map((t) => <Row todo={t} />)}` | `<For each={todos()} keyed={(t) => t.id}>` |
| `<For each={todos().map(t => t)}>` | derive first, then `<For each={visible()}>` |
| `class={`btn ${on() ? "on" : ""}`}` / `clsx("btn", on() && "on")` / `.filter(Boolean).join(" ")` | `class={["btn", { on: on() }]}` |
| `style={{ width: 80 }}` (no unit) | `style={{ width: `${80}px` }}` |
| `const rest = { ...props }` | `const rest = omit(props, "label")` |
| `const user = createMemo(async () => { await fetch(...); return id(); })` | read `id()` **before** `await` |
| `action(async function* () { await save(); setX(v); })` | `yield save()` or `await save(); yield; setX(v)` |
| `todos()` on a store | `todos.length` / `todo.title` (property reads) |
| `setTodos((t) => t.filter((x) => x.ok))` | mutate the draft, or `reconcile` |
| `createEffect(() => user, (u) => log(u.name))` | `createEffect(() => user.name, (name) => log(name))` |
| `<Loading fallback={<PageSkeleton />}>{/* header + data */}</Loading>` | wrap only the data slot; chrome stays outside |
| `<Loading on={id} fallback={...}>` (the accessor) | `on={id()}` — a value, so identity changes can show fallback |
| `setCount(count() + 1)` when writes can batch | `setCount((c) => c + 1)` |
| `setHandler(fn)` to store a function | `setHandler(() => fn)` (otherwise `fn` is an updater) |
| `{user() ? <P user={user()!} /> : <SignIn />}` | `<Show when={user()}>{(u) => <P user={u()} />}</Show>` |
| `<Child user={user()} />` for an async memo | `<Child user={user} />` and read `props.user()` under the child's `<Loading>` |
| `lazy(() => import("./p").then((m) => ({ default: m.About })))` | `lazy(() => import("./p"), { export: "About" })` |
| `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html }}` | `innerHTML={html()}` (sanitized); never with JSX children |
| `onClick={setCount}` | `onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}` |
| `event.target.value` | `event.currentTarget.value` |
| `createContext(emptyStore)` for reactive state | `createContext<Todos>()` — dummy defaults silently no-op |
| `<For keyed={(t) => t.id}>{(todo) => todo.title}` | `todo().title` — key-function items are accessors |
| `{list().length ? <For each={list()}> : <Empty />}` | `<For each={list()} fallback={<Empty />}>` |
| `<For each={rows.slice(from, from + n)}>` | `<Repeat from={from()} count={n}>` |
| `{count() && <Badge />}` | `<Show when={count()}>` — `0` must not render as text |
| `throw new Error("expired")` from a server function (prod) | `throw markSafeError(...)` or `throw respond(body, { status })` |
| `GET(async (id) => { "use server"; await db.delete(id) })` | mutations stay on POST; `GET()` is for idempotent reads |
| `live()` yields as an event log to append | each yield **replaces** the current answer; yield current state first |
| `<article innerHTML={html()}>…children…</article>` | `innerHTML` **or** children, not both |
| `fallback={(error) => <p>{error.message}</p>}` | `error` is an accessor: `error().message` (or `String(error())`) |
| `import { action } from "solid-js"` on a `<form>` | `import { action } from "@solidjs/router"` + `<form action={save} method="post">` (core `action` is a generator transaction, not a form URL) |
| `createMemo(async () => fetchUser(id()))` when `@solidjs/router` is present | `query(fetchUser, "users")` + `createMemo(() => getUser(id()))`; after mutations `revalidate(getUser.key)`, not core `refresh()` |
| `onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); fetch(...) }}` for a router/server action | `<form action={save} method="post">` (POST only; `.with(id)` binds args into the URL). `useAction` is JS-only |
| `query(saveUser, "users")` wrapping a mutation | don't wrap mutations in `query` — an undeclared server function becomes GET |
| `render(<App />, root)` / Testing Library `render(<Counter />)` | `render(() => <App />, root)` — pass a function so Solid creates the root first |
| `render` onto SSR HTML / `hydrate` into an empty node | `hydrate(() => <App />, root)` when HTML already exists; `render` for an empty mount |
| `renderToString(() => <App />)` for an async or lazy-route tree | `await renderToStream(() => <App />)` (one consumer: `pipe` / `pipeTo` / `readable`). String render emits `<Loading>` fallbacks |
| `clientOnly(() => import("./Map"))` for a rarely shown widget | same + `{ lazy: true }` so the import waits until first render (default starts at declaration) |
| `<NoHydration><Chart /></NoHydration>` to skip SSR of a widget | `clientOnly(() => import("./Chart"))` — `NoHydration`/`Hydration` split ownership, they do not choose visible content |
| `await flush()` / `flush()` to wait on a pending memo | `await resolve(() => value())` (or Testing Library async queries); `flush()` only drains staged *sync* writes |
| `action(function* () { setX(v); })` around a navigation-shaped setter | plain setter; async computeds hold previous values. Core `action` only when writes happen *after* async work |
| `createContext` + a root provider for a true app singleton | module-level signal/store (SSR: shared across requests). Context is subtree scoping |
| `import { GET } from "@solidjs/start"` / `createAsync` / `useSubmission` / `<FileRoutes />` / `"use client"` | `GET` from `@solidjs/web/server-functions`; `createMemo(() => getUser(id()))`; `useSubmissions`; `fileRoutes(pageRoutes)`; Solid has no `"use client"` |
| `<Show keyed when={user()}>` by default | default `Show` (keeps children mounted); `keyed` only when internal state must reset |
| overlapping truthy `<Match>`es all expected to render | first truthy `<Match>` wins; later matches are skipped |
| missing `<HydrationScript />` / one script for many roots | once, before app markup, when the app owns the document; distinct `renderId` per extra root |
| `Router.paths` as the current URL; calling `preload()` and using the return as props | `useLocation` / `useParams`; factory/route `preload` result is `props.data` |
| `query.get(key)` with no guaranteed entry; `query.set(key, promise)` | `query.get` throws if missing; `query.set` does not accept a promise |

```tsx
// WRONG — post-await read never subscribes; production can hang pending
const user = createMemo(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/me');
  const extra = flag(); // too late
  return { ...(await response.json()), extra };
});

// CORRECT
const user = createMemo(async () => {
  const extra = flag();
  const response = await fetch('/api/me');
  return { ...(await response.json()), extra };
});
```

```tsx
// WRONG — rest is a plain object snapshot
function Field(props: { label: string; class?: string }) {
  const rest = { ...props };
  return <label>{props.label}<input {...rest} /></label>;
}

// CORRECT
function Field(props: { label: string; class?: string }) {
  const rest = omit(props, 'label');
  return <label>{props.label}<input {...rest} /></label>;
}
```

```tsx
// WRONG — user() throws not-ready at Page; child's <Loading> never sees it
function Page() {
  const user = createMemo(async () => (await fetch('/api/me')).json());
  return <Profile user={user()} />;
}

// CORRECT — pass the accessor; read it under the boundary that owns the fallback
function Profile(props: { user: Accessor<User> }) {
  return (
    <Loading fallback={<p>Loading…</p>}>
      <h1>{props.user().name}</h1>
    </Loading>
  );
}
function Page() {
  const user = createMemo(async () => (await fetch('/api/me')).json());
  return <Profile user={user} />;
}
```

```tsx
// WRONG — two different `action`s; the core one is not a form URL
import { action } from 'solid-js';
const save = action(async function* (form: FormData) {
  yield persist(form);
});
<form onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); void save(new FormData(e.currentTarget)); }}>
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>

// CORRECT — router action is POST-addressable (only if `@solidjs/router` is in the project)
import { action } from '@solidjs/router';
const save = action(async (form: FormData) => persist(form), 'save');
<form action={save} method="post">
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

```tsx
// WRONG — evaluating JSX before the root exists
import { render } from '@solidjs/web';
render(<App />, document.getElementById('app')!);

// CORRECT
render(() => <App />, document.getElementById('app')!);
```

## Checking the official docs

Solid 2.0 docs: https://v2.solidjs.com/ — the site blocks non-browser fetchers, so from an
agent use the mirror, which serves every page as plain markdown:

- Index of all pages: `https://v2-rebuild--solid-docs-v2.netlify.app/llms.txt`
- Single-file corpus: `https://v2-rebuild--solid-docs-v2.netlify.app/llms-full.txt`
- Any page: append `.md`, e.g. `https://v2-rebuild--solid-docs-v2.netlify.app/reference/solid-js/reactivity/create-signal.md`

A curated URL list is in [references/official-docs.md](references/official-docs.md).

**Never** consult Solid 1.x sources (docs.solidjs.com, pre-2.0 tutorials, old Stack Overflow).
Solid 2.0 is a breaking rewrite; 1.x answers are wrong here. The banned-API table is in the
always-applied rules installed alongside this skill.

## Review checklist (before finishing any TSX change)

- [ ] No props destructuring; no `props.` at component-body top level.
- [ ] Every reactive read (`signal()`, `props.x`, `store.x`) sits in JSX, a memo, an effect
      compute, or a boundary — not the component body.
- [ ] No signal-synced-by-effect; derived values are functions or memos.
- [ ] Event handlers wrap setters (`onClick={() => setX(...)}`), use `currentTarget`,
      and `onInput` for keystrokes. `innerHTML` is sanitized and not mixed with children.
- [ ] Async memos are passed as accessors (`user={user}`), not `user={user()}`, so
      `<Loading>` around the *read* can catch not-ready.
- [ ] Lists via `<For>` (server/refetched rows keyed by stable id), conditionals via
      ternary/`<Show>`; no `{list().map(...)}` in JSX; no `key` props; no `value()!`.
- [ ] Effects are two-phase and only at imperative boundaries; apply does not read stores.
- [ ] Async reads sit under `<Loading>` (the data slot, not chrome); errors under `<Errored>`.
      Reactive inputs of an async memo are read before the first `await`. No hand-rolled
      `loading`/`error` signals or `=== undefined` readiness branches; refetch via
      `refresh`, not counter signals.
- [ ] External collections reconcile into stores (function-form `createStore` /
      `reconcile`), never wholesale draft assignment or `setTodos((t) => t.filter(...))`
      as the identity-preserving update.
- [ ] Rest props via `omit`, not `{ ...props }`. Conditional `class` via objects, not string concat.
- [ ] Input filters write back to the DOM on reject (inputs do not rewind).
- [ ] No Solid 1.x imports or APIs (`solid-js/store`, `createResource`, `onMount`, `Suspense`, ...).
- [ ] Inspect children with `children()`; code-split with `lazy` + `<Loading>`; reactive
      component choice with `dynamic()`. No `React.lazy`, no effects inside ref callbacks.
- [ ] Browser-only code uses `isServer` / `clientOnly`, not `typeof window`.
- [ ] If the project has a router: `createRouter({ routes })`, not JSX `<Route>` / `<A>`.
      Router `action`/`query` come from `@solidjs/router` (POST forms + cache), not
      core `action`/`refresh`. Forms: `<form action={save} method="post">`.
- [ ] `render(() => <App />, root)` — a function, not `render(<App />)`. `hydrate` when
      HTML already exists. Stream async/lazy trees (`await renderToStream(...)`).
- [ ] `jsxImportSource` is `@solidjs/web`; Vite plugin is `@solidjs/vite-plugin`.
      No `@solidjs/start`, `vinxi`, `"use client"`, or Next.js imports.
- [ ] Single return per component; no early returns on reactive conditions.
- [ ] `solid2-kit check` and the project's typecheck pass; `solid2-kit doctor` too if
      `package.json`, tsconfig, or root config files changed.
